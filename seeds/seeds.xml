    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wireless revolution has touched off a huge demand for Palm OS network applications. But information on how to connect a Palm is fragmented across dry function listings in the SDK documentation, a couple of book chapters, some sample code, and a few articles on the Palm web site (each of which assumes prior knowledge of network applications).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Palm OS Network Programming&lt;/i&gt; pulls all the necessary elements together in the first complete guide to developing network applications for the Palm Computing Platform. The author assumes knowledge of Palm programming in C, but no network experience is required. You'll learn Palm network concepts such as transport protocols and client-server applications from the ground up, clearly illustrated with examples using Metrowerks CodeWarrior development environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Palm Net Library, essential to any network application development, gets the detailed treatment it deserves, with sample network applications demonstrating how to make the best use of this powerful system library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Palm OS Network Programming&lt;/i&gt; is the first complete developer's resource to building creative--and connected--applications for the fastest-growing platform of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Just in time for the wireless revolution comes the first complete guide to creating network applications for the Palm computing platform. &lt;i&gt;Palm OS Network Programming&lt;/i&gt; covers the Palm Net Library and networking concepts such as transport protocols and client-server applications. Abundant examples illustrate how the many Palm-specific nuances relate to effective Palm network programming, so you learn to build truly well-designed connected Palm applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colliding billiard balls. Missile trajectories. Cornering dynamics in speeding cars. By applying the laws of physics, you can realistically model nearly everything in games that bounces around, flies, rolls, slides, or isn't sitting still, to create compelling, believable content for computer games, simulations, and animation. &lt;i&gt;Physics for Game Developers&lt;/i&gt; serves as the starting point for those who want to enrich games with physics-based realism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part one is a mechanics primer that reviews basic concepts and addresses aspects of rigid body dynamics, including kinematics, force, and kinetics. Part two applies these concepts to specific real-world problems, such as projectiles, boats, airplanes, and cars. Part three introduces real-time simulations and shows how they apply to computer games. Many specific game elements stand to benefit from the use of real physics, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The trajectory of rockets and missiles, including the effects of fuel burn off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The collision of objects such as billiard balls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The stability of cars racing around tight curves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The dynamics of boats and other waterborne vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The flight path of a baseball after being struck by a bat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The flight characteristics of airplanes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't need to be a physics expert to learn from &lt;i&gt;Physics for Game Developers,&lt;/i&gt; but the author does assume you know basic college-level classical physics. You should also be proficient in trigonometry, vector and matrix math (reference formulas and identities are included in the appendixes), and college-level calculus, including integration and differentiation of explicit functions. Although the thrust of the book involves physics principles and algorithms, it should be noted that the examples are written in standard C and use Windows API functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 2000 Pro combines the friendly interface  of Windows 98 with the famous stability of Windows NT. Windows 2000, the  successor to NT, introduces many technologies that weren't available in  NT, including Plug-and-Play, support for USB devices, power management  features, and more. It's 25% faster than Windows 98 and three times as stable. Unfortunately, despite all the enhancements, Microsoft forgot to  address one of NT's most glaring omissions: Windows 2000 doesn't include  a printed user's manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt; Windows 2000 Pro: The Missing Manual,&lt;/i&gt;  bestselling Windows NT  author Sharon Crawford provides the ideal (and desperately needed) user's  guide for the world's most popular corporate operating system. The book  covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting started.&lt;/b&gt; The early chapters cover using menus, finding  lost files, reducing window clutter, and taming the wild Start menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's what. &lt;/b&gt;A complete guide, this book explains the purpose  of every Control Panel item, accessory program, and maintenance tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mastering the network. &lt;/b&gt;Special chapters help you navigate the  corporate network, dial in from the road, and even set up your own  small-office (peer-to-peer) network, step by step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understanding security. &lt;/b&gt;User accounts, file encryption, and the  NTFS file system keep your private files private, while still offering network  access to coworkers you specify.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flying the Net. &lt;/b&gt;This book demystifies the rich Internet suite of  Windows 2000 Pro: its email, newsgroup, Web-browsing, and video  conferencing programs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Pro: The Missing Manual &lt;/i&gt; isn't for system  administrators or OS theory geeks; it's for the novice or budding power user  who wants to master the machine and get down to work. &lt;i&gt;Windows 2000  Pro: The Missing Manual &lt;/i&gt; is the crystal-clear, jargon-free book that  should have been in the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtually everything--not just computers, but every kind of device--is coming  on board the Internet, and the two principal applications are the World Wide  Web and email.  The POP3 model for online-only messaging is being taxed to  its limit, and users clearly would like mail servers with more  "oomph."  More specifically, the demand is for email servers that take  advantage of centralized resources to manage mail, rather than heap more  tasks on end-user computers.  This clamor has resulted in  the IMAP protocol being incorporated into virtually every major email server on  the market. Those who haven't already installed IMAP are probably  planning to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Managing IMAP&lt;/i&gt; is a movable feast of IMAP help.  It is a handy guide  for everyday tasks common to most IMAP servers as well as a concise  reference to help navigate the sometimes sparsely and obtusely  documented open source software.  Whether the goal is more insight into the  IMAP server and client or utility software, or big-picture strategic  suggestions to get off a legacy system, &lt;i&gt;Managing IMAP&lt;/i&gt; is here to  help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is both a conceptual and a mechanical IMAP road map.  Managers,  system integrators, and system administrators on the front lines of  Internet messaging will find it a valuable tool for IMAP system provision,  maintenance and support. It is also useful if you're considering IMAP for  your messaging system. &lt;i&gt;Managing IMAP&lt;/i&gt; covers the IMAP protocol,  setting up  a client, IMAP security, performance monitoring, and tools. Several  chapters are devoted specifically to two of the most popular servers: the  University of Washington server and Cyrus, and detailed appendixes cover  topics such as TCL, procmail, Sieve, and sendmail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are faced with switching over to the powerful but often  confusing Windows 2000, &lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Quick Fixes &lt;/i&gt;offers  something completely new: not just solutions, but a fast, easy way to  find them. Designed with the power user in mind, this book is laid out  for optimal accessibility; it defines problems clearly and follows up  with concise, yet detailed, solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Quick Fixes&lt;/i&gt; is an essential reference for both the  novice and the well-seasoned Microsoft OS user. For instance, newcomers  to Windows 2000 who have children using their computers can quickly  learn how to protect some areas without walling off the entire system.  Old hands at Windows will learn quick and easy new ways to recover data  or what to do when the administrator's password's been forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many of the oversized and poorly organized books on the market,
&lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Quick Fixes&lt;/i&gt; doesn't waste time with endless  tutorials, fluff, and useless background material. And while the book is  designed for easy access, the material is by no means basic. It provides  extensive coverage of problems for both the Windows 2000 Professional  and Windows 2000 Server editions, and takes power users from  installation issues, through complex networking configuration problems,  to important backup and security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setting up a dual-boot system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recovering data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resolving hardware configuration conflicts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restoring the Registry from a back up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making a printer available through the Internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using automatic address assignment without DHCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring Internet Connection Sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hosting a web site&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its clear, well-organized fixes to common problems,
&lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Quick Fixes&lt;/i&gt; is the book to reach for  when the pressure is on and there's no time to waste hunting  for buried solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Quick Fixes&lt;/i&gt; provides fixes to common problems in a clear, well-organized fashion. It extensively troubleshoots both the Windows 2000 Professional and the Windows 2000 Server editions, taking power users through installation, complex networking configuration problems, and important backup and security concerns.

    <title>Oracle and Open Source</title>
    <author>Andy Duncan, Sean Hull</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oracle &amp;amp; Open Source&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to tie together the commercial world of Oracle and the free-wheeling world of open source software. As this book reveals, these two worlds are not as far apart as they may seem. Today, there are many excellent and freely available software tools that Oracle developers and database administrators can use, at no cost, to improve their own coding productivity and their system's performance. Moreover, many of the finest Oracle developers are now making their source code freely available so their peers can build upon this code base. Oracle Corporation is even porting its RDBMS to Linux and starting to incorporate a growing number of open source tools in the company's own software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oracle &amp;amp; Open Source &lt;/i&gt;describes close to 100 open source tools you can use for Oracle development and database administration, from large and widely known open source systems (like Linux, Perl, Apache, TCL/Tk and Python) to more Oracle-specific tools (like Orasoft, Orac, OracleTool, and OraSnap). You'll learn how to obtain the software and how to adapt it to best advantage. The book abounds with code examples, download and installation instructions, and helpful usage hints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Not only does it tell you how to find and use existing open source code;
&lt;i&gt;Oracle &amp;amp; Open Source&lt;/i&gt; gives you the details and the motivation to build your own open source contributions and release them to the Oracle community. You'll learn all about tools like the Oracle Call Interface (OCI) and Perl-DBI (Database Interface), which provide the glue allowing new open source tools to link into commercial Oracle software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With &lt;i&gt;Oracle &amp;amp; Open Source&lt;/i&gt; as a guide, you'll discover an enormous number of highly effective open source tools, while getting involved with the thriving community of open source development.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first book to tie together the commercial world of Oracle and the free-wheeling world of open source software. It describes nearly 100 open source tools, from the widely applied (like Linux, Perl, and Apache) to the Oracle-specific (like Orasoft, Orac, OracleTool, and OraSnap). You'll learn where to find them, what their advantages are, and how to create and release new open source Oracle tools yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Internet, there are almost no barriers against international commerce. Except for language. Unfortunately, most software is still written in English. &lt;i&gt;Java Internationalization&lt;/i&gt; shows how to write software that is truly multi-lingual, using Unicode, a standard system  that supports hundreds of character sets for most modern languages and many ancient ones.  English-only software is already obsolete. &lt;i&gt;Java Internationalization&lt;/i&gt; brings Java developers up to  speed on the new generation of software development: writing software  that is no longer limited by language boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explores Java Unicode and provides concrete  examples for using its features to create multilingual user interfaces;  to correctly format currency, dates and times; and to ensure font  support for different languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perl is a powerful programming language that  has grown in popularity since it first appeared in 1988. The first edition of this book, &lt;i&gt;Programming Perl,&lt;/i&gt; hit the shelves in 1990, and was quickly adopted as the  undisputed bible of the language. Since then, Perl  has grown with the times, and so has this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Perl&lt;/i&gt; is not just a book about Perl. It is  also a unique introduction to the language and its culture,  as one might expect only from its authors. Larry Wall is the inventor of Perl, and provides a unique perspective on  the evolution of Perl and its future direction. Tom Christiansen was one of the first champions of the language,  and lives and breathes the complexities of Perl internals  as few other mortals do. Jon Orwant is the editor of
&lt;i&gt;The Perl Journal,&lt;/i&gt; which has brought together the Perl  community as a common forum for new developments in Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Perl book can show the syntax of Perl's functions, but only this one is a comprehensive guide to all the nooks and crannies of the language. Any Perl book can explain typeglobs, pseudohashes, and closures, but only this one shows  how they really work. Any Perl book can say that &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; is faster than &lt;i&gt;local,&lt;/i&gt; but only this one explains why. Any Perl book  can have a title, but only this book is affectionately known by all Perl programmers as "The Camel."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This third edition of &lt;i&gt;Programming Perl&lt;/i&gt; has been expanded to cover version 5.6 of this maturing language. New topics include threading, the compiler, Unicode, and other  new features that have been added since the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What do we need to know about to discover life in space?" --Frank Drake, 1961&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early 1960s, Frank Drake, a young astronomer with the National  Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, West Virginia,  developed what is now known as the "Drake Equation" in an effort to  determine how many intelligent, communicative civilizations our galaxy  could harbor. For forty years, the Search for Extraterrestrial  Intelligence (SETI) has combed the skies in search of signals from star  systems within the galaxy. In &lt;i&gt;Beyond Contact: A Guide to SETI and Communicating with Alien Civilizations,&lt;/i&gt; author Brian McConnell goes  behind the scenes and examines  what goes into the search for intelligent life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SETI is a four-step process. First we have to know where to look; then  we must be able to send and receive signals to that star system. Once  signals arrive, scientists then need to be able to interpret those  signals into something that can be understood. And although we haven't  yet received any signals (except for our own Earth-based transmissions),  we'll eventually have to figure out a protocol for responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beyond Contact&lt;/i&gt; introduces you to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The history of SETI research, including the early searches of  Project Ozma, traditional radio astronomy, the search for intelligence  in optical wavelengths (known as Optical SETI, or OSETI), and the  SETI@home project. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;An overview of the Drake Equation and the Rare Earth Hypothesis,  which scientists use to estimate the number of planets in our galaxy  that could harbor intelligent, communicative life forms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How signals are sent and received over interstellar distances.  The author explains the principles of signal and image processing, and  how SETI researchers identify and process analog signals using Fourier  transforms to see how the power in a signal is distributed across  different frequencies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How to build a general-purpose symbolic language for sending  signals, and even computer programs, with present-day SETI equipment.  The ability to transmit computer programs enables us to let another  civilization know about our knowledge and technological capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author also shows how SETI research--though often thought to be a  mere flight of fancy--has spawned technological improvements in  astronomy, computers, and wireless communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beyond Contact: A Guide to SETI and Communicating with Alien Civilizations&lt;/i&gt; sidesteps the  "little green men" approach to take a hard, realistic look at the  technologies behind the search for intelligent life in our universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Beyond Contact: A Guide to SETI and Communicating with Alien Civilizations,&lt;/i&gt; author Brian McConnell examines the science and technology behind the search for intelligent life in space, from the physics of inter-stellar laser and radio communication to information theory and linguistics. If you've ever wondered whether it really would be possible to communicate with other civilizations, you'll want to read this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On today's networks it's common to have users running Windows, Apple,  Novell, and many versions of Unix. Each operating system has its own  printing facility and there is little or nothing in common between  them--there is no single system for print spooling. Yet all users want to be  able to print, and most of the time they have to share the same  printers. The network administrator has to solve this problem as  efficiently as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly's &lt;i&gt;Network Printing &lt;/i&gt;shows network administrators a way  out of this problem. It details how to set up a network printing system  that's based on Linux, but can handle printing from Windows, Novell,  Apple, and any version of Unix.  To this end, it offers thorough  discussions of the Unix printing facility (both LPR and LPRng); Samba's  printer sharing; Netatalk, a free implementation of the AppleTalk  protocol; and ncpfs, a Linux implementation of the Netware protocols.   The book also shows how to get printers to boot correctly on a network,  using solutions like bootp and DHCP; how to manage printers remotely  using SNMP; and how to set up a network-wide printer configuration  repository with LDAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Network Printing &lt;/i&gt;shows you how to set up a network printing architecture that supports all kinds of clients, using Linux machines as print servers. It covers the standard Unix print servers on BSD and System V, LPRng (the next generation Berkeley spooling system), Samba printing services, and using LDAP as a configuration repository for printers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers of Active Server Pages often reinvent the wheel. Their background in web design, with its separate HTML page for each viewable web page on a site, leads many ASP developers to create a distinct ASP page each time they think they need one. Often times, these pages are functionally similar. With intelligent planning, an ASP developer stands to save a great deal of time by creating reusable ASP pages.
&lt;i&gt;Designing Active Server Pages&lt;/i&gt; is tailor-made for these developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently a plethora of Active Server Pages books. However, the vast majority of these books are either technical references or how-to books for beginners. &lt;i&gt;Designing Active Server Pages&lt;/i&gt; is written for the intermediate to advanced user. Furthermore, nearly every other book on ASP focuses on using VBScript, even though ASP supports an array of scripting languages, including JScript and PerlScript. &lt;i&gt;Designing Active Server Pages&lt;/i&gt; shows how to start using these other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest version of the scripting engines (Version 5.1 for VBScript) adds new features not available before the 5.0 release. These features include class support for VBScript, and Regular Expression searching through the use of a COM object. &lt;i&gt;Designing Active Server Pages&lt;/i&gt; explains why using classes in VBScript is beneficial, and demonstrates the power of regular expression searching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book shows how to simplify the process by only requiring one ASP page to handle ALL of the Forms throughout a web site, thus reducing the amount of code one has to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using various Microsoft and third-party components to enhance ASP pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating components using VB and/or VC++&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sample code for performing routine ASP tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Techniques to allow for reusable database scripts on the database system and on ASP pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to obtain and register third-party components, thus saving massive amounts of time by reusing someone else's code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Designing Active Server Pages&lt;/i&gt; is for developers who have already mastered the basics of ASP application development and are ready to take the next logical step. It is sure to become an indispensable part of every web developer's library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Designing Active Server Pages&lt;/i&gt; is written for those who have already mastered the basics of ASP application development and are ready to move to the next level--such as creating reusable ASP pages that can save a great deal of development time. And unlike other books on ASP, &lt;i&gt;Designing Active Server Pages&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to use other scripting languages that ASP supports in addition to VBScript.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the first edition of this classic reference was published,  World Wide Web use has exploded and e-commerce has become a  daily part of business and personal life. As Web use has grown,  so have the threats to our security and privacy--from credit  card fraud to routine invasions of privacy by marketers to web  site defacements to attacks that shut down popular web sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Web Security, Privacy &amp;amp; Commerce&lt;/i&gt; goes behind the  headlines, examines the major security risks facing us today,  and explains how we can minimize them.  It describes risks for  Windows and Unix, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape  Navigator, and a wide range of current programs and products.  In vast detail, the book covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Web technology--The technological underpinnings  of the modern Internet and the cryptographic foundations of  e-commerce are discussed, along with SSL (the Secure Sockets Layer),  the significance of the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure), and digital  identification, including passwords, digital signatures, and biometrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Web privacy and security for users--Learn the real risks  to user privacy, including cookies, log files, identity theft, spam,  web logs, and web bugs, and the most common risk, users' own willingness  to provide e-commerce sites with personal information. Hostile mobile  code in plug-ins, ActiveX controls, Java applets, and JavaScript, Flash,  and Shockwave programs are also covered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Web server security--Administrators and service providers  discover how to secure their systems and web services. Topics include CGI,  PHP, SSL certificates, law enforcement issues, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Web content security--Zero in on web publishing issues  for content providers, including intellectual property, copyright and  trademark issues, P3P and privacy policies, digital payments, client-side  digital signatures, code signing, pornography filtering and PICS, and  other controls on web content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly double the size of the first edition, this completely updated volume is destined to be the definitive reference on Web security risks and the techniques  and technologies you can use to protect your privacy, your organization, your  system, and your network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This much expanded new edition explores web security risks and how to minimize them. Aimed at web users, administrators, and content providers, &lt;i&gt;Web Security, Privacy &amp;amp; Commerce&lt;/i&gt; covers cryptography, SSL, the Public Key Infrastructure, digital signatures, digital certificates, privacy threats (cookies, log files, web logs, web bugs), hostile mobile code, and web publishing (intellectual property, P3P, digital payments, client-side digital signatures, code signing, PICS).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load balancing improves network performance by distributing traffic efficiently so that individual servers are not overwhelmed by sudden fluctuations in activity. &lt;i&gt;Server Load Balancing&lt;/i&gt; is a guide to this critical component of &lt;i&gt;high availability, clustering,&lt;/i&gt; and
&lt;i&gt;fault tolerance,&lt;/i&gt; all of which provide the infrastructure for reliable Internet sites and large corporate networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the information on load balancing comes from vendor-specific manuals that use inconsistent terminology and are often biased toward the products they cover. &lt;i&gt;Server Load Balancing &lt;/i&gt;explains to engineers and technicians the concepts and terminology of load balancing and offers practical guidance for planning and implementing it in almost any environment. It includes a configuration guide with diagrams and sample configurations for installing, configuring, and maintaining products from the four major vendors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alteon WebSystems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco's CSS Series (formerly ArrowPoint)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;F5's BIG-IP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Foundry ServerIron series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing several load balancing products, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the technology and how best to use it to improve your network performance. No system administrator responsible for traffic management should be without this practical guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is not just a browser. Mozilla is also a framework that allows developers to create cross-platform applications. This framework is made up of JavaScript, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and Mozilla's XUL (XML-based User-interface Language) as well as the Gecko rendering engine, XBL (eXtensible Binding Language), XPCOM (Mozilla's component model), and several other components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Creating Applications with Mozilla&lt;/i&gt; explains how applications are created with Mozilla and provides step-by-step information about how you can create your own programs using Mozilla's powerful cross-platform development framework. This book also shows examples of many different types of existing applications to demonstrate some of the possibilities of Mozilla application development. One of Mozilla's biggest advantages for a developer is that Mozilla-based applications are cross-platform, meaning programs work the same on Windows as they do on Linux or the Mac OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working through the book, you are introduced to the Mozilla development environment and after installing Mozilla, you quickly learn to create simple applications. After the initial satisfaction of developing your own portable applications, the book branches into topics on modular development and packaging your application. In order to build more complex applications, coverage of XUL, JavaScript, and CSS allow you to discover how to customize and build out your application shell. The second half of the book explores more advanced topics including UI enhancement, localization, and remote distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla 1.0 was released on June 5th, 2002, after more than four years of development as an open source project. This book has been written so that all of the information and examples will work with this release and any of the 1.0.x maintenance releases. In addition to Netscape's Mozilla-based browsers (Netscape 6.x and 7.x), the Mozilla framework has been used to create other browsers such as Galeon and Chimera, and chat clients such as ChatZilla and JabberZilla. Developers have also used Mozilla to create games, development tools, browser enhancements, as well as all sorts of other types of applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Mozilla is not just a browser.

    <title>Windows Me Annoyances</title>
    <author>David A. Karp</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, an operating system is a collection of software that handles a computer's "dirty work" invisibly, quickly, and most of all, painlessly. For many of us, however, Microsoft Windows exists outside this ideal world. We are annoyed by "personalized Menus" that keep changing, icons we don't use cluttering up our workspace, periodic crashes, unintelligible error messages, and inadequate documentation to help us figure it all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows Me Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; has the insider information you need for overcoming Windows' many annoyances and limitations. Whether you're looking to finally solve a nagging problem, dramatically improve system performance, or customize the interface to better suit your work habits, the &lt;i&gt;Windows Me Annoyances &lt;/i&gt;solution-oriented format makes finding information and implementing solutions easy and pain free. Thanks to the thorough and relevant documentation on the registry, Windows Scripting Host, and Windows' built-in networking capabilities, customizing and improving Windows Me is easier than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the author's extremely popular &lt;a href="http://www.annoyances.org" target="new"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annoyances.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; web sites, &lt;i&gt;Windows Me Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; delivers an authoritative collection of techniques and tools for customizing Windows Me, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several approaches and hidden tools for working with the Windows registry, the database of system- and application-specific configuration information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to bypass Windows roadblocks such as the Home Networking and System Restore wizards, allowing you to take control of the processes quickly and painlessly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tutorial and reference on automation with the Windows Scripting Host as a means of eliminating many Windows Me annoyances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using third-party software and utilities to handle some of the more complex workarounds and customizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with software that overwrites your file associations and other settings without warning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows Me Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; is the intermediate and advanced Windows user's best resource for turning Windows into the user-friendly, customizable interface it was meant to be, but doesn't always manage to be on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the author's popular &lt;a href="http://www.annoyances.org" target="new"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annoyances.org&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; web sites, &lt;i&gt;Windows Me Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; is an authoritative collection of techniques for customizing Windows Me. Packed with creative and seldom-documented ways to quickly identify and fix a particular annoyance or customize Windows for individual needs, it's the definitive resource for dealing with crashes, unintelligible error messages, unwanted icons, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popular open source KDE desktop environment for Unix was built with Qt, a C++ class library for writing GUI applications that run on Unix, Linux, Windows 95/98, Windows 2000, and Windows NT platforms. Qt emulates the look and feel of Motif, but is much easier to use. Best of all, after you have written an application with Qt, all you have to do is recompile it to have a version that works on Windows. Qt also emulates the look and feel of Windows, so your users get native-looking interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platform independence is not the only benefit. Qt is flexible and highly optimized. You'll find that you need to write very little, if any, platform-dependent code because Qt already has what you need. And Qt is free for open source and Linux development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although programming with Qt is straightforward and feels natural once you get the hang of it, the learning curve can be steep. Qt comes with excellent reference documentation, but beginners often find the included tutorial is not enough to really get started with Qt. That's where
&lt;i&gt;Programming with Qt&lt;/i&gt; steps in. You'll learn how to program in Qt as the book guides you through the steps of writing a simple paint application. Exercises with fully worked out answers help you deepen your understanding of the topics. The book presents all of the GUI elements in Qt, along with advice about when and how to use them, so you can make full use of the toolkit. For seasoned Qt programmers, there's also lots of  information on advanced 2D transformations, drag-and-drop, writing custom image file filters, networking with the new Qt Network Extension, XML processing, Unicode handling, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming with Qt&lt;/i&gt; helps you get the most out of this powerful, easy-to-use, cross-platform toolkit. It's been completely updated for Qt Version 3.0 and includes entirely new information on rich text, Unicode/double byte characters, internationalization, and network programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

If you are an Oracle DBA moving to Unix  from another environment such as Windows NT or IBM Mainframe, you know  that these commands are far different from those covered in most  beginning Unix books. To jump start your learning process, Don Burleson  has gathered together in this succinct book the Unix commands he most  often uses when managing Oracle databases. You'll be able to reach into  your pocket for the answer when you need to know how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Display all Unix components related to Oracle, identify the top CPU  consumers on your server, and even kill processes when necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Stack Unix commands into powerful scripts that can perform vital DBA  functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Monitor Unix filesystems, and automatically manage your trace files,  dump files, and archived redo log files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Use essential server monitoring commands such as top, sar, and  vmstat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there's much more between these covers. If you need to get up to  speed with Oracle on Unix, and quickly, this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is a thorough introduction to Java Message Service (JMS), the standard Java application program interface (API) from Sun Microsystems that supports the formal communication known as "messaging" between computers in a network. JMS provides a common interface to standard messaging protocols and to special messaging services in support of Java programs. The messages exchange crucial data between computers, rather than between users--information such as event notification and service requests. Messaging is often used to coordinate programs in dissimilar systems or written in different programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the JMS interface, a programmer can invoke the messaging services of IBM's MQSeries, Progress Software's SonicMQ, and other popular messaging product vendors. In addition, JMS supports messages that contain serialized Java objects and messages that contain Extensible Markup Language (XML) pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messaging is a powerful new paradigm that makes it easier to uncouple different parts of an enterprise application. Messaging clients work by sending messages to a message server, which is responsible for delivering the messages to their destination. Message delivery is asynchronous, meaning that the client can continue working without waiting for the message to be delivered. The contents of the message can be anything from a simple text string to a serialized Java object or an XML document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Message Service &lt;/i&gt;shows how to build applications using the point-to-point and publish-and-subscribe models; how to use features like transactions and durable subscriptions to make an application reliable; and how to use messaging within Enterprise JavaBeans. It also introduces a new EJB type, the MessageDrivenBean, that is part of EJB 2.0, and discusses integration of messaging into J2EE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Effective awk Programming,&lt;/i&gt;3rd Edition, focuses entirely on
&lt;i&gt;awk,&lt;/i&gt; exploring it in the greatest depth of the three &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt;  titles we carry. It's an excellent companion piece to the more broadly focused second edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book provides complete coverage of the &lt;i&gt;gawk&lt;/i&gt; 3.1 language as  well as the most up-to-date coverage of the POSIX standard for
&lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; available anywhere. Author Arnold Robbins clearly  distinguishes standard &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; features from GNU &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;(gawk)&lt;/i&gt;-specific features, shines light into many of the "dark  corners" of the language (areas to watch out for when programming),  and devotes two full chapters to example programs. A brand new chapter is devoted to TCP/IP networking with gawk.  He includes a summary  of how the &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; language evolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Internationalization of &lt;i&gt;gawk&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interfacing to i18n at the &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; level
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two-way pipes
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TCP/IP networking via the two-way pipe interface
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new PROCINFO array, which provides information about running &lt;i&gt;gawk&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Profiling and pretty-printing &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; programs
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to covering the &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; language, this book serves as the  official "User's Guide" for the GNU implementation of &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt;  (&lt;i&gt;gawk&lt;/i&gt;), describing in an integrated fashion the extensions  available to the System V Release 4 version of &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; that are also  available in &lt;i&gt;gawk&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the official &lt;i&gt;gawk&lt;/i&gt; User's Guide, this book will also be  available electronically, and can be freely copied and distributed under  the terms of the Free Software Foundation's Free Documentation License  (FDL). A portion of the proceeds from sales of this book will go to the  Free Software Foundation to support further development of free and open  source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third edition of &lt;i&gt;Effective awk Programming&lt;/i&gt; is a GNU Manual and is published by O'Reilly &amp;amp; Associates under the &lt;a href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free Software Foundation's&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free Documentation License&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (FDL).

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Solaris operating system, along with related Sun products like
Java, is one of the most reliable and scalable platforms on which
to build e-commerce products, and on which to support all networked
services. Yet, one problem that potential users face is finding out
more information about what Solaris offers. In a sense, they want to
know how much technical work is involved in migrating to Solaris,
and what kind of philosophy Solaris is based on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, &lt;i&gt;Solaris 8 Administrator's Guide&lt;/i&gt;
covers all aspects of deploying Solaris as a network server, including
both basic and advanced network services. Given newfound interest in
Solaris as an enterprise network operating system, this guide is aimed
squarely at supporting enterprise-level services. It's written for
experienced network administrators who want an objective guide to
networking with Solaris, and covers installation on both the Intel
and Sparc platforms. With it, you will learn how to setup Solaris as
a file server, application server, and database server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its coverage of advanced topics, &lt;i&gt;Solaris 8 Administrator's Guide&lt;/i&gt;
offers examples of configuration files and the installation of third-party
software packages. This comprehensive book also contains more conceptual
and difficult material that is absent from other Solaris reference manuals.
At all points, emphasis is placed on issues like evaluating the security,
scalability, and reliability of specific software packages--at the expense
of providing detailed coverage of every available package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book covers the practical experience and new skills needed to understand
the impact of new services and new software products on existing server systems.
Author Paul Watters--a recognized authority on Solaris--avoids so-called
"historical" services, like UUCP, which can easily fill chapters but are
not commonly found in today's production environments. Indeed, he doesn't
bother to provide an in-depth history of Solaris or UNIX at all, assuming
that you can find this material elsewhere. Instead, the practical focus is
on supporting relevant contemporary networking technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Solaris 8 Administrator's Guide&lt;/i&gt; provides you with a third-party view
that not only praises Solaris, but is critical and realistic in its assessment.
This book is for experienced Solaris Administrators as well as and those looking
to migrate to this operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This guide covers all aspects of deploying Solaris as an enterprise-level network operating system, with a focus on e-commerce. Written for experienced network administrators who want an objective guide to networking with Solaris, the book covers installation on the Intel and Sparc platforms, and instructs you how to setup Solaris as a file server, application server, and database server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many books describe the theory behind Voice over IP, only &lt;i&gt;Practical VoIP Using VOCAL&lt;/i&gt; describes how such a phone system was actually built, and how you too can acquire the source code, install it onto a system, connect phones, and make calls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
VOCAL (the Vovida Open Communication Application Library) is an open source software project that provides call control, routing, media, policy, billing information and provisioning on a system that can range from a single box in a lab with a few test phones to a large, multi-host carrier grade network supporting hundreds of thousands of users. VOCAL is freely available from the Cisco Systems-sponsored Vovida.org community web site (www.vovida.org).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A Silicon Valley start-up called Vovida Networks, Inc (think of VOice, VIdeo, DAta) created VOCAL and invested over one hundred man years into its development. Since Cisco acquired Vovida in 2000, individuals representing every significant telecom company and service provider in the world have downloaded the source code. Today, more and more people are successfully building VOCAL into professional solutions, while contributing fixes and new functionality back to Vovida.org. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Because VOCAL is open source, you can look "under the hood" to the base code and protocol stack levels and discover not only how the system works, but also how common problems are being worked out in the development environment. We're hoping that you will be inspired to take this system to another level by implementing a feature or functionality that no one has thought of before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Written by a team from Vovida Networks, &lt;i&gt;Practical VoIP Using VOCAL&lt;/i&gt; includes the following topics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installing and configuring VOCAL 1.4.0 onto a single host and onto a multi-host network with phones and gateways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++, C and Java architecture found within VOCAL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisioning a VoIP system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SIP (Session Initiation Protocol), SDP (Session Description Protocol) and RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) for call control and media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRIP (Telephony Routing over IP), DNS SRV and ENUM for routing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol) and H.323 for call control and translation into SIP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COPS (Common Open Policy Service), OSP (Open Settlement Protocol) and RSVP (Reservation Protocol) for policy and Quality of Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) for interfacing with billing servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you're interested in VoIP, this is the only book available that focuses on the real issues facing programmers and administrators who need to work with these technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;While many books describe the theory behind Voice over IP, only this one describes how such a phone system was actually built, and how you too can acquire the source code, install it onto a system, connect phones, and make calls.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its highly developed capacity to detect patterns in data, Perl has become one of the most popular languages for biological data analysis. But if you're a biologist with little or no programming experience, starting out in Perl can be a challenge. Many biologists have a difficult time learning how to apply the language to bioinformatics. The most popular Perl programming books are often too theoretical and too focused on computer science for a non-programming biologist who needs to solve very specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics&lt;/i&gt; is designed to get you quickly over the Perl language barrier by approaching programming as an important new laboratory skill, revealing Perl programs and techniques that are immediately useful in the lab. Each chapter focuses on solving a particular bioinformatics problem or class of problems, starting with the simplest and increasing in complexity as the book progresses. Each chapter includes programming exercises and teaches bioinformatics by showing and modifying programs that deal with various kinds of practical biological problems. By the end of the book you'll have a solid understanding of Perl basics, a collection of programs for such tasks as parsing BLAST and GenBank, and the skills to take on more advanced bioinformatics programming. Some of the later chapters focus in greater detail on specific bioinformatics topics. This book is suitable for use as a classroom textbook, for self-study, and as a reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Programming basics and working with DNA sequences  and strings &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Debugging your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Simulating gene mutations using random number generators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Regular expressions and finding motifs in data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Arrays, hashes, and relational databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Regular expressions and restriction maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Using Perl to parse PDB records, annotations in  GenBank, and BLAST output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book shows biologists with little or no programming experience how to use Perl, the ideal language for biological data analysis. Each chapter focuses on solving a particular problem or class of problems, so you'll finish the book with a solid understanding of Perl basics, a collection of programs for such tasks as parsing BLAST and GenBank, and the skills to tackle more advanced bioinformatics programming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Office 2001 for Macintosh: The Missing Manual</title>
    <author>Nan Barber, David Reynolds</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the surprise of most Mac fans, the number one bestselling Macintosh  software is Microsoft Office for the Macintosh. It's by far the most  popular Macintosh software, and the first software purchase a new Mac  user is likely to make. And for the first time, Office 2001 comes  without a single page of printed instructions. The packaging is a five- inch-square clear plastic case housing the CD-ROM and little else.  Fortunately, Pogue Press/O'Reilly is once again ready to embrace the  befuddled and overwhelmed--with &lt;i&gt;Office 2001 for Macintosh:  The Missing Manual.&lt;/i&gt; It tackles each of the primary Office  applications with depth, humor, and clarity, and provides relief for the  hapless Mac user who'd rather read professionally written printed  instructions than hunt through a maze of personality-free help screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is structured to help the beginner as well as the seasoned  user. Part One provides an overview of Word. From "What's New," to  "Basic Word Processing," to "Document Design," to "Advanced Word  Processing"--with in-depth details on creating Web pages and performing mail merges using Word. Part Two covers the new  Palm-syncable calendar in Entourage, including all aspects of  email, how to best use the calendar and address book, and  crucial information on the Palm Hotsync. Part three  explains all the finer points of Excel, including Microsoft's exciting  new "List Manager," specifically designed for creating and manipulating  lists without the prerequisite of learning spreadsheet tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Office 2001 for Macintosh: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is  coauthored by a dream team of Missing Manual alumni: David Reynolds,  executive editor of &lt;i&gt;MacAddict&lt;/i&gt; magazine and coauthor of
&lt;i&gt;AppleWorks 6: The Missing Manual,&lt;/i&gt; and Nan Barber, whose efforts  as the copy editor of the first four Missing Manual titles gave her an  intuitive feeling for the friendly, funny, authoritative voice  of the series. Once again, the authors are joined by series founder  David Pogue, who has closely edited the book to ensure excellence of  depth, accuracy, and prose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Office 2001 for Macintosh: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; tackles each of the primary Office applications with depth, humor, and clarity, and provides relief for the hapless Mac user who'd rather read professionally written printed instructions than hunt through a maze of personality-free help screens. This book is a must-read for any Mac Office 2001 user.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;JDBC is the key Java technology for relational  database access. Oracle is arguably the most  widely used relational database platform in  the world. In this book, Donald Bales brings these  two technologies together, and shows you how to  leverage the full power of Oracle's implementation  of JDBC.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You begin by learning the all-important mysteries  of establishing database connections. This can be  one of the most frustrating areas for programmers  new to JDBC, and Donald covers it well with detailed  information and examples showing how to make  database connections from applications, applets,  Servlets, and even from Java programs running  within the database itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Next comes thorough coverage of JDBC's relational  SQL features. You'll learn how to issue SQL  statements and get results back from the database,  how to read and write data from large, streaming  data types such as BLOBs, CLOBs, and BFILEs, and  you'll learn how to interface with Oracle's other  built-in programming language, PL/SQL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you're taking advantage of the Oracle's relatively  new ability to create object tables and column  objects based on user-defined datatypes, you'll be  pleased with Don's thorough treatment of this subject.  Don shows you how to use JPublisher and JDBC to work  seamlessly with Oracle database objects from within  Java programs. You'll also learn how to access  nested tables and arrays using JDBC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Donald concludes the book with a discussion of transaction  management, locking, concurrency, and performance--topics  that every professional JDBC programmer must be familiar  with. If you write Java programs to run against an Oracle  database, this book is a must-have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how to leverage JDBC, a key Java technology used to access relational data from Java programs, in an Oracle environment. Author Donald Bales begins by teaching you the mysteries of establishing database connections, and how to issue SQL queries and get results back. You'll move on to advanced topics such as streaming large objects, calling PL/SQL procedures, and working with Oracle9i's object-oriented features, then finish with a look at transactions, concurrency management, and performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The web services architecture provides a new way to think about and implement application-to-application integration and interoperability that makes the development platform irrelevant. Two applications, regardless of operating system, programming language, or any other technical implementation detail, communicate using XML messages over open Internet protocols such as HTTP or SMTP.  The Simple Open Access Protocol (SOAP) is a specification that details how to encode that information and has become the messaging protocol of choice for Web services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Web Services with SOAP&lt;/i&gt; is a detailed guide to using SOAP and other leading web services standards--WSDL (Web Service Description Language), and UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration protocol). You'll learn the concepts of the web services architecture and get practical advice on building and deploying web services in the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This authoritative book decodes the standards, explaining the concepts and implementation in a clear, concise style. You'll also learn about the major toolkits for building and deploying web services. Examples in Java, Perl, C#, and Visual Basic illustrate the principles. Significant applications developed using Java and Perl on the Apache Tomcat web platform address real issues such as security, debugging, and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covered topic areas include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The Web Services Architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;SOAP envelopes, headers, and encodings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;WSDL and UDDI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Writing web services with Apache SOAP and Java&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Writing web services with Perl's SOAP::Lite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) web services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Enterprise issues such as authentication, security, and identity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Up-and-coming standards projects for web services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Web Services with SOAP&lt;/i&gt; provides you with all the information on the standards, protocols, and toolkits you'll need to integrate information services with SOAP. You'll find a solid core of information that will help you develop individual Web services or discover new ways to integrate core business processes across an enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Web Services with SOAP&lt;/i&gt; introduces you to building distributed Web-based applications using the SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI protocols. You'll learn the XML underlying these standards, as well as how to use the popular toolkits for Java and Perl. The book also addresses security and other enterprise issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Python Standard Library&lt;/i&gt; is an essential guide for serious Python programmers. Python is a modular language that imports most useful operations from the standard library (basic support modules; operating system interfaces; network protocols; file formats; data conversions; threads and processes; and data storage). You can't really program in Python without using it. In this book, author Fredrik Lundh, creator of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), delivers tested, accurate documentation of all the modules in the Python Standard Library, along with  over 300 annotated example scripts using the modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Python Standard Library&lt;/i&gt; renders this valuable information in a clean, easy-to-read format, yet doesn't talk down to readers. This accurate and complete reference documentation is for the Python programmer who wants the facts and little else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is based on the author's work with the Python newsgroup: he reviewed more than 2500 questions and answers to that newsgroup in order to make sure the book covered what Python users really wanted to know. An earlier version of this book has been available electronically for over a year, so the material has been tested by Python programmers in real-life applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This version of &lt;i&gt;Python Standard Library&lt;/i&gt; covers all the new modules and related information for Python 2.0, the first new major release of Python in four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Exim: The Mail Transfer Agent</title>
    <author>Philip Hazel</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exim delivers electronic mail, both local and remote. It has all the virtues of a good postman: it's easy to talk to, reliable, efficient, and eager to accommodate even the most complex special requests. It's the default mail transport agent installed on some Linux systems, runs on many versions of Unix, and is suitable for any TCP/IP network with any combination of hosts and end-user mail software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exim is growing in popularity because it is open source, scalable, and rich in features such as the following:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compatibility with the calling interfaces and options of  Sendmail (for which Exim is usually a drop-in replacement)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lookups in LDAP servers, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and NIS or NIS+ services
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support for many kinds of address parsing, including regular expressions that are compatible with Perl 5
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sophisticated error handling
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Innumerable tuning parameters for improving performance and handling enormous volumes of mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best of all, Exim is easy to configure. You never have to deal with ruleset 3 or worry that a misplaced asterisk will cause an inadvertent mail bomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a basic configuration is easy to read and can be created quickly, Exim's syntax and behavior do get more subtle as you enter complicated areas like virtual hosting, filtering, and automatic replies. This book is a comprehensive survey that provides quick information for people in a hurry as well as thorough coverage of more advanced material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slash is the open source software system that drives the hugely  popular Slashdot web site and many others.  Slash implements the  kind of web site that has come to be called a "weblog":  a moderated  list, in reverse chronological order, of timely items with links to  further discussion on-site, or to further information off-site.   Essentially, a weblog is a cooperatively authored daily newspaper  for some defined community on the net.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Slash has spawned several imitators.  The existence of so many  different systems for operating a weblog site demonstrates that  there are many people and groups on the net who want to run their  own online community newspapers.  Slash is based on open source  technologies (Perl, Apache, and MySQL), and it makes use of open  protocols (XML and RDF) for exchanging headlines with other sites.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyone who wants to get a weblog site up and running will want to  read this book, particularly system administrators who may not have  the time or the background to learn all about Slash by reading the  source code.  Content managers of Slash sites who want to be able  to use the system more effectively will also benefit from this book,  which organizes the knowledge currently distributed throughout the Slash  source code, Slashcode web site, and mailing lists, and provides it  in an organized package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>COM &amp; .NET Component Services</title>
    <author>Juval Lowy</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;COM and .NET Component Services,&lt;/i&gt; skilled COM developers can leverage their knowledge for the next generation of components to be built for Microsoft's new .NET framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A primary goal of Microsoft's COM+ is to provide proven design solutions for scalable systems. Assuming experience with classic COM, &lt;i&gt;COM and .NET Component Services&lt;/i&gt; focuses on the added services of COM+, including support for transactions, queued components, events, concurrency management, and security. Along the way, it ably demonstrates that COM+ is a masterpiece of design and usability from the ground up--truly a mature set of component services oriented for the middle tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COM+ provides a foundation for robust, enterprise-wide,  mission-critical distributed applications. And it's not limited to Internet applications. You can use COM+ services in the same places as classic COM components: in-house two-tier information systems, client-tier controls, desktop applications, machine control components, and every other conceivable application of COM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;COM and .NET Component Services&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to stress the importance of learning to use COM+ services for both .NET and COM component-based applications. Since most companies have considerable investment in existing code base and development skills, COM+ can serve as a migration path for companies and developers. Companies can start (or continue) their projects in COM, using COM+ as a supporting platform for component services, and then when the time comes to move to .NET, they can start plugging .NET components seamlessly into the same architecture, reusing and interacting with their existing COM components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;COM and .NET Component Services&lt;/i&gt; provides both traditional COM programmers and new .NET component developers with the information they need to begin developing applications that take full advantage of COM+ services. This book focuses on COM+ services, including support for transactions, queued components, events, concurrency management, and security.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago, in &lt;i&gt;1984,&lt;/i&gt; George Orwell imagined a future in  which privacy was demolished by a totalitarian state that used spies,  video surveillance, historical revisionism, and control over the media  to maintain its power. Those who worry about personal privacy and  identity--especially in this day of technologies that encroach upon  these rights--still use Orwell's "Big Brother" language to discuss  privacy issues. But the reality is that the age of a monolithic Big  Brother is over. And yet the threats are perhaps even more likely to  destroy the rights we've assumed were ours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; shows  how, in these early years of the 21st century, advances in technology  endanger our privacy in ways never before imagined. Direct marketers and  retailers track our every purchase; surveillance cameras observe our  movements; mobile phones will soon report our location to those who want  to track us; government eavesdroppers listen in on private  communications; misused medical records turn our bodies and our  histories against us; and linked databases assemble detailed consumer  profiles used to predict and influence our behavior. Privacy--the most  basic of our civil rights--is in grave peril. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simson Garfinkel--journalist, entrepreneur, and international authority  on computer security--has devoted his career to testing new technologies  and warning about their implications. This newly revised update of the  popular hardcover edition of &lt;i&gt;Database Nation &lt;/i&gt; is his compelling  account of how invasive technologies will affect our lives in the coming  years. It's a timely, far-reaching, entertaining, and thought-provoking  look at the serious threats to privacy facing us today. The book poses a  disturbing question: how can we protect our basic rights to privacy,  identity, and autonomy when technology is making invasion and control  easier than ever before? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garfinkel's captivating blend of journalism, storytelling, and futurism  is a call to arms. It will frighten, entertain, and ultimately convince  us that we must take action now to protect our privacy and identity  before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open source provides the competitive advantage in the Internet Age.  According to the August Forrester Report, 56 percent of IT managers  interviewed at Global 2,500 companies are already using some type of  open source software in their infrastructure and another 6 percent will  install it in the next two years. This revolutionary model for  collaborative software development is being embraced and studied by  many of the biggest players in the high-tech industry, from Sun  Microsystems to IBM to Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Cathedral &amp;amp; the Bazaar&lt;/i&gt; is a must for anyone who cares  about the future of the computer industry or the dynamics of the  information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and  lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied,  debated, and implemented for years to come. According to Bob Young,  "This is Eric Raymond's great contribution to the success of the open  source revolution, to the adoption of Linux-based operating systems,  and to the success of open source users and the companies that  supply them." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interest in open source software development has grown  enormously in the past year. This revised and expanded paperback  edition includes new material on open source developments in 1999 and  2000. Raymond's clear and effective writing style accurately describing  the benefits of open source software has been key to its  success. With major vendors creating acceptance for open source  within companies, independent vendors will become the open source  story in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term "peer-to-peer" has come to be applied to networks that  expect end users to contribute their own files, computing time, or  other resources to some shared project. Even more interesting than  the systems' technical underpinnings are their socially disruptive  potential: in various ways they return content, choice, and control to  ordinary users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this book is mostly about the technical promise of peer-to-peer, we  also talk about its exciting social promise.  Communities have been forming  on the Internet for a long time, but they have been limited by the flat  interactive qualities of email and Network newsgroups. People can exchange  recommendations and ideas over these media, but have great difficulty  commenting on each other's postings, structuring information, performing  searches, or creating summaries. If tools provided ways to organize  information intelligently, and if each person could serve up his or her own  data and retrieve others' data, the possibilities for collaboration would take  off. Peer-to-peer technologies along with metadata could enhance almost any  group of people who share an interest--technical, cultural, political, medical,  you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book presents the goals that drive the developers of the  best-known peer-to-peer systems, the problems they've faced, and the  technical solutions they've found.  Learn here the essentials of  peer-to-peer from leaders of the field:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Subclassing and Hooking with Visual Basic</title>
    <author>Stephen Teilhet</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Subclassing &amp;amp; Hooking with Visual Basic&lt;/i&gt; offers developers a  unique way to customize Windows behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows is a message-based system. Every action you request creates one or more messages to carry out the action. These messages are passed between objects and carry with them information that gives the recipient more detail on how to interpret and act upon the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Subclassing and the Windows hooking mechanism ("hooks"),  you can manipulate, modify, or even discard messages bound for other objects within the operating system, in the process changing the way the system behaves. What kinds of results can you achieve using the power of subclassing and hooking? Here are just a few of the possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Determine when a window is being activated or deactivated and respond to this change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Display descriptions of menu items as the mouse moves across them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Disallow a user to move or resize a window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Determine where the mouse cursor is and respond accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Determine when the display resolution has been changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Monitor the system for a low system resource condition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Modify or disallow keystrokes sent to a window or a control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Create an automated testing application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Determine when an application is idle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with this power comes responsibility; Windows is very unforgiving if subclassing and hooking are used incorrectly. &lt;i&gt;Subclassing &amp;amp; Hooking with Visual Basic&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates the various techniques for intercepting messages bound for one or more windows or controls: the intercepted message can be left in its original state or modified; afterwards, the message can be sent to its original destination or discarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both VB 6 and VB.NET developers, &lt;i&gt;Subclassing &amp;amp; Hooking with Visual  Basic&lt;/i&gt; opens up a wealth of possibilities that  ordinarily would be completely unavailable, or at least not easy to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever needed to share processing between two or more computers running programs written in different languages on different operating  systems? Or have you ever wanted to publish information on the Web so that programs other than browsers could work with it? XML-RPC, a system for remote procedure calls built on XML and the ubiquitous HTTP protocol, is the solution you've been looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Web Services with XML-RPC&lt;/i&gt; introduces the simple but powerful capabilities of XML-RPC, which lets you connect programs running on different computers with a minimum of fuss, by wrapping procedure calls in XML and establishing simple pathways for calling functions. With XML-RPC, Java programs can talk to Perl scripts, which can talk to Python programs, ASP applications, and so on. You can provide access to procedure calls without having to worry about the system on the other end, so it's easy to create services that are available on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML-RPC isn't the only solution for web services; the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is another much-hyped protocol for implementing web services. While XML-RPC provides fewer capabilities than SOAP, it also has far fewer interoperability problems and its capabilities and limitations are much better understood. XML-RPC is also stable, with over 30 implementations on a wide variety of platforms, so you can start doing real work with it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Web Services with XML-RPC&lt;/i&gt; covers the details of five XML-RPC implementations, so you can get started developing distributed applications in Java, Perl, Python, ASP, or PHP. The chapters on these implementations contain code examples that you can use as the basis for your own work. This book also provides in-depth coverage of the XML-RPC specification, which is helpful for low-level debugging of XML-RPC clients and servers. And if you want to build your own XML-RPC implementation for another environment, the detailed explanations in this book will serve as a foundation for that work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle database administration is a complex and stressful job. In a series of easy-to-use checklists, this concise pocket reference summarizes the enormous number of tasks you must perform as an Oracle DBA. Each section takes a step-by-step "cookbook" approach to presenting DBA quick-reference material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Oracle DBA Checklists Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is divided into three major sections covering the main areas of an Oracle DBA's responsibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Database management.&lt;/b&gt; Describes how to maintain existing databases (with a checklist of daily, weekly, and monthly activities), prepare new databases for production, and back up and recover databases (with  checklists for how to recover tables, data files, index files, control files, rollback segments, and active and inactive redo logs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Installation and configuration.&lt;/b&gt; Contains a summary of key procedures for installation on Unix, Windows NT, and VMS platforms. Also includes special steps for configuring a parallel database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Network management.&lt;/b&gt; Helps with installing, configuring, and testing Net8 software on server and client machines. Tasks include confirming network availability and Net8 connectivity, verifying Net8 name resolution, configuring Net8 clients (with LDAP or Oracle Names), configuring Net8 on the server, configuring the Multi-Threaded Server (MTS), tracing client connections, and tracing the Net8 listener.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book's quick-reference, step-by-step approach takes the stress out of DBA problem solving by making it easy to find the information you need--and find it fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the key decisions and tradeoffs you face as you design and develop enterprise applications?  How do you build the back end so that it not only handles your current needs but is flexible enough to allow your system to evolve as your needs expand?  Answer these questions and many more with &lt;i&gt;Building Java Enterprise Applications&lt;/i&gt;, an advanced guide to building complex Java Enterprise Applications from the ground up that addresses design issues along the way. These practical books take a step back from detailed examination of the APIs and focus on the entire picture, so you can put the pieces together and build something that works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explores the infrastructure issues so important to good application design. It isn't just a book about doing things with Entity Beans, JDBC and JMS and JNDI.   It takes you step by step through building the back end, designing the data store so that it gives you convenient access to the data your application needs; designing a directory; figuring out how to handle security and where to store security credentials you need; and so on.  On top of this, it shows -- as easily as possible --how to build the entity bean layer that makes information available to the rest of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this guide, author Brett McLaughlin uses his wealth of real-world experience with enterprise development to show you one step at a time how to design and build a comprehensive enterprise application from the ground up, starting with the back end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <author>Paul Lomax, Matt Childs, Ron Petrusha</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript), a subset of Visual Basic for Applications, is a powerful language for Internet application development, where it can serve as a scripting language for server-side, client-side, and system scripting. Whether you're developing code for Active Server Pages, client-side scripts for Internet Explorer, code for Outlook forms, or scripts for Windows Script Host, &lt;i&gt;VBScript Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; will be your constant companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't let the pocket-friendly format fool you. Based on the bestselling
&lt;i&gt;VBScript in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, this small book details every VBScript language element--every statement, function, and object--both in VBScript itself, and in the Microsoft Scripting Runtime Library. There's a special emphasis on the following details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The syntax, using standard code conventions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The arguments accepted by the function or procedure, if any exist

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entries are arranged alphabetically by topic, so that you can, for instance, easily find details about that string-handling function that you can't quite remember. In addition, appendixes list VBScript operators and VBScript intrinsic constants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how much VBScript programming experience you have, the
&lt;i&gt;VBScript Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is the book you'll pick up time and time again as your standard quick reference guide to the VBScript language. It is indispensable for anyone writing scripts with VBScript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven't worked with T1 before, you could be in for an unpleasant surprise. If you have, you'll already know that T1, the current network standard for business and professional Internet access, is neither efficient, easy to use, nor particularly well-suited to data transmission. &lt;i&gt;T1: A Survival Guide,&lt;/i&gt; a practical, applied reference on T1 data transport, is a life raft for navigating the shoals of a 40-year-old technology originally designed for AT&amp;amp;T's voice network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout T1's long life, network administrators have mainly learned it by apprenticeship, stumbling on troubleshooting tidbits and filing them away until they were needed again. This book brings together in one reference the information you need to set up, test, and troubleshoot T1.
&lt;i&gt;T1: A Survival Guide &lt;/i&gt;covers the following broad topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;What components are needed to build a T1 line, and how those components interact to transmit data effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use standardized link layer protocols to adapt the T1 physical layer to work with data networks
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to troubleshoot problems and work with the telephone company, equipment manufacturers, and Internet service providers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of its limitations, T1 is a proven, reliable technology that currently meets the need for medium-speed, high reliability Internet access by institutions of many sizes, and it's likely to be around for a while. &lt;i&gt;T1: A Survival Guide&lt;/i&gt; will take the guesswork out of using T1 as a data transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This practical, applied reference to T1 for system and network administrators brings together in one place the information you need to set up, test, and troubleshoot T1. You'll learn what components you need to build a T1 line; how the components interact to transmit data; how to adapt the T1 to work with data networks using standardized link layer protocols; troubleshooting strategies; and working with vendors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of XSLT is its ability to change the structure or format of any content that can be converted to XML. &lt;i&gt;Java and XSLT&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to use XSL transformations in Java programs ranging from stand-alone applications to servlets. After an introduction to XSLT, the book focuses on applying transformations in some real-world scenarios, such as developing a discussion forum, transforming documents from one form to another, and generating content for wireless devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java and XSLT&lt;/i&gt; discusses several common XSLT processors and the TRAX API, paying special attention to performance issues. Although there's a brief tutorial introduction to the XSLT language, the primary focus of the book isn't on learning XSLT or developing stylesheets; it's on making practical use of transformations in Java code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Introduction and Technology Review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;XSLT--The Basics&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Object-Oriented Programming with Visual Basic .NET</title>
    <author>J.P. Hamilton</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant features of Visual Basic .NET is the full support of object-oriented programming.  For years, developers have been asking for it, but you may not be quite sure how it can help to create and maintain scalable .NET applications.  VB.NET is a language that facilitates object-oriented programming, but does not guarantee good object-oriented code.  That's where &lt;i&gt;Object-Oriented Programming with Visual Basic .NET&lt;/i&gt; comes in.  It will show you how to think about similarities in your application logic and how to design and create objects that maximize the benefit and power the .NET Framework enables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of separating the interface from the implementation has been around for years, but with &lt;i&gt;Object-Oriented Programming with Visual Basic .NET&lt;/i&gt; you'll put it all into practice and you'll never willingly go back to those old ways.  With chapters on object fundamentals and class anatomy, you'll lay a foundation that will prepare you to think and apply code reuse principles.  Following that, you'll be ready to dive deep into code and the dynamic ecology that it interacts with. Inheritance, containment, polymorphism, overloading, and overriding are just the beginning of this adventure.  From there, you'll discover exception handling, reflection, serialization, and I/O. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packed with examples that will guide you through every step, &lt;i&gt;Object-Oriented Programming with Visual Basic .NET&lt;/i&gt; is a guide for those with some programming experience.  This book is for those who know Visual Basic 6.0 and are ready or have started the process of developing with Visual Basic .NET.  It is an essential tool that will build your skills, as you become a master of Visual Basic .NET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to know how to write object-oriented code. Knowing the when and the why is what makes good programmers. That's exactly what you'll know after reading this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows administrators can accomplish many of their routine tasks much more quickly by using the command line (similar to the command line of DOS or Unix-based systems) than by going through the graphical user interface that most users associate with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows 20000 Commands Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; documents the Windows command mode. It's designed for system administrators, but will also be valuable to many users. It includes most available Windows 2000 commands, as well as the most useful system administration command-line utilities from the Resource Kit. Weeded out of this book are Windows commands and command options that are obscure, obsolete, broken, unacceptably insecure, or frankly inadvisable, as well a few special-purpose classes of commands. Whenever several utilities perform essentially identical tasks, we include only the best of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commands are grouped according to their purpose and function; within a group, commands are arranged alphabetically. Options for each command are grouped by function and ordered by importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Commands Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; complements &lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Administration in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; by conveying the kind of no-nonsense, boiled-down information typical of O'Reilly's highly successful companion Pocket Reference series. It's a valuable, concise reference to Windows 2000 commands and command-line utilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Designing Large Scale Lans</title>
    <author>Kevin Dooley</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unique book offers a vendor-neutral approach for designing large  local area networks according to business or organizational needs,  rather than from a product perspective. Author and independent network  design consultant Kevin Dooley outlines "top-down network design" for  building a technological infrastructure to fit your organization's  requirements, a process far more effective and cost-efficient than  fitting the organization to the parameters of a shrink-wrapped proprietary  solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dooley argues that the design of a network is largely independent of  the products used. Whether you use a Cisco or Juniper router, the same  security issues and protocols apply. The questions he addresses in this  book are need-specific: Do I use a router or a switch? Should I route  between switched areas or switch between routed areas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Designing Large-Scale LANs&lt;/i&gt; covers everything from security,  bandwidth and scalability to network reliability, which includes backup,  redundancy, and points of failure. Specific technologies are analyzed in  detail: network topologies, routing and switching strategies, wireless,  virtual LANs, firewalls and gateways, security, Internet protocols,  bandwidth, and multicast services. The book also discusses proprietary  technologies that are ubiquitous, such as Cisco's IOS and Novell's IPX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This complete guide to top-down network design will help you choose  the right network solutions. If you're designing large scale networks  and need expert advice and guidance, look no further than &lt;i&gt;Designing  Large-Scale LANs&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data is the lifeblood of modern business, and modern data centers have extremely demanding requirements for size, speed, and reliability. Storage Area Networks (SANs) and Network Attached Storage (NAS) allow organizations to manage and back up huge file systems quickly, thereby keeping their lifeblood flowing.   W. Curtis Preston's insightful book takes you through the ins and outs of building and managing large data centers using SANs and NAS.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As a network administrator you're aware that multi-terabyte data stores are common and petabyte data stores are starting to appear.   Given this much data, how do you ensure that it is available all the time, that access times and throughput are reasonable, and that the data can be backed up and restored in a timely manner?  SANs and NAS provide solutions that help you work through these problems, with special attention to the difficulty of backing up huge data stores.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book explains the similarities and differences of SANs and NAS to help you determine which, or both, of these complementing technologies are appropriate for your network.   Using SANs, for instance, is a way to share multiple devices (tape drives and disk drives) for storage, while NAS is a means for centrally storing files so they can be shared.   Preston exams each technology with a vendor neutral approach, starting with the building blocks of a SAN and how they can be assembled for effective storage solutions.   He covers day-to-day management and backup and recovery for both SANs and NAS in detail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whether you're a seasoned storage administrator or a network administrator charged with taking on this role, you'll find all the information you need to make informed architecture and data management decisions.  The book fans out to explore technologies such as RAID and other forms of monitoring that will help complement your data center.  With an eye on the future, other technologies that might affect the architecture and management of the data center are explored.  This is sure to be an essential volume in any network administrator's or storage administrator's library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Java's most striking claims is that it provides a secure programming environment. Yet despite endless discussion, few people understand precisely what Java's claims mean and how it backs up those claims. If you're a developer, network administrator or anyone else who must understand or work with Java's security mechanisms, Java Security is the in-depth exploration you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Security,&lt;/i&gt; 2nd Edition, focuses on the basic platform features of Java that provide security--the class loader, the bytecode verifier, and the security manager--and recent additions to Java that enhance this security model: digital signatures, security providers, and the access controller. The book covers the security model of Java 2, Version 1.3, which is significantly different from that of Java 1.1. It has extensive coverage of the two new important security APIs: JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) and JSSE (Java Secure Sockets Extension). &lt;i&gt;Java Security,&lt;/i&gt; 2nd Edition, will give you a clear understanding of the architecture of Java's security model and how to use that model in both programming and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is intended primarily for programmers who want to write secure Java applications. However, it is also an excellent resource for system and network administrators who are interested in Java security, particularly those who are interested in assessing the risk of using Java and need to understand how the security model works in order to assess whether or not Java meets their security needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The second edition focuses on the platform features of Java that provide security--the class loader, bytecode verifier, and security manager--and recent additions to Java that enhance this security model: digital signatures, security providers, and the access controller.

    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning Carbon&lt;/i&gt; is designed to get you programming right away in Carbon&amp;#8482;, one of two APIs (Application Programmer Interfaces)  Macintosh&amp;#174; programmers can use to write applications that run native in Mac&amp;#174; OS X. Using Carbon, you don't have to rewrite your Mac OS programs entirely to get them to take advantage of the new features in Mac OS X. Instead, all you have to rewrite is the 10 to 20 percent of the code that can't be translated to OS X. For C programmers, Apple's Carbon is the essential building block for applications on Mac OS X. With Carbon, you can use simple, traditional C interfaces to create world-class applications for a world-class operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After orienting you with a detailed tour of a Carbon application, &lt;i&gt;Learning Carbon&lt;/i&gt; walks you through the entire process of designing and creating a complete Carbon application called Moon Travel Planner. Along the way, you'll be introduced to two pivotal development tools: Project Builder and Interface Builder. You'll learn key concepts about Carbon and Mac OS X programming, including event management, resource handling, and bundle anatomy. And you'll get direct, hands-on instruction on how to implement essential application tasks, such as managing windows, printing documents, opening and saving files, creating and responding to menu commands, providing user help, and organizing your application for easy localization in multiple countries and languages. After finishing this book, you'll be ready to start writing your own Carbon applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by Apple insiders with access to engineers deeply involved in creating Mac OS X, &lt;i&gt;Learning Carbon&lt;/i&gt; brings you information that's not available anywhere else, to get you in on the ground floor of the exciting new Mac OS X application development market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Get up to speed quickly on creating Mac&amp;#174; OS X applications with Carbon&amp;#8482;. You'll learn the fundamentals and key concepts of Carbon programming as you design and build a complete application under the book's guidance. Written by insiders at Apple Computer, &lt;i&gt;Learning Carbon &lt;/i&gt;provides information you can't get anywhere else, giving you a head start in the Mac OS X application development market.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squid is the most popular Web caching software in use today, and it works on a variety of platforms including Linux, FreeBSD, and Windows.  Squid improves network performance by reducing the amount of bandwidth used when surfing the Web.  It makes web pages load faster and can even reduce the load on your web server.  By caching and reusing popular web content, Squid allows you to get by with smaller network connections.  It also protects the host on your internal network by acting as a firewall and proxying your internal web traffic.  You can use Squid to collect statistics about the traffic on your network, prevent users from visiting inappropriate web sites at work or school, ensure that only authorized users can surf the Internet, and enhance your privacy by filtering sensitive information from web requests.  Companies, schools, libraries, and organizations that use web-caching proxies can look forward to a multitude of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by Duane Wessels, the creator of Squid, &lt;i&gt;Squid: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; will help you configure and tune Squid for your particular situation.  Newcomers to Squid will learn how to download, compile, and install code.  Seasoned users of Squid will be interested in the later chapters, which tackle advanced topics such as high-performance storage options, rewriting requests, HTTP server acceleration, monitoring, debugging, and troubleshooting Squid.&lt;/p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a network administrator, auditor or architect, you know the importance of securing your network and finding security solutions you can implement quickly.  This succinct book departs from other security literature by focusing exclusively on ways to secure Cisco routers, rather than the entire network. The rational is simple: If the router protecting a network is exposed to hackers, then so is the network behind it. &lt;i&gt;Hardening Cisco Routers&lt;/i&gt; is a reference for protecting the protectors. Included are the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;The importance of router security and where routers fit into an overall security plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Different router configurations for various versions of Cisco?s IOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Standard ways to access a Cisco router and the security implications of each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Password and privilege levels in Cisco routers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Router warning banner use (as recommended by the FBI) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Unnecessary protocols and services commonly run on Cisco routers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;SNMP security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Anti-spoofing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Protocol security for RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, NTP, and BGP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Logging violations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Incident response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Physical security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by Thomas Akin, an experienced Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Certified Cisco Academic Instructor (CCAI), the book is well organized, emphasizing practicality and a hands-on approach. At the end of each chapter, Akin includes a Checklist that summarizes the hardening techniques discussed in the chapter.  The Checklists help you double-check the configurations you have been instructed to make, and serve as quick references for future security procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concise and to the point, &lt;i&gt;Hardening Cisco Routers&lt;/i&gt; supplies you with all the tools necessary to turn a potential vulnerability into a strength.  In an area that is otherwise poorly documented, this is the one book that will help you make your Cisco routers rock solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Web Performance Tuning</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as there's been a Web, people have been trying to make it faster. The maturation of the Web has meant more users, more data, more features, and consequently longer waits on the Web. Improved performance has become a critical factor in determining the usability of the Web in general and of individual sites in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Web Performance Tuning, 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt; is about getting the best possible performance from the Web. This book isn't just about tuning web server software; it's also about streamlining web content, getting optimal performance from a browser, tuning both client and server hardware, and maximizing the capacity of the network itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Web Performance Tuning&lt;/i&gt; hits the ground running, giving concrete advice for quick results -- the "blunt instruments" for improving crippled performance right away. The book then shifts gears to give a conceptual background of the principles of computing performance. The latter half of the book examines each element of a web transaction -- from client to network to server -- to find the weak links in the chain and show how to strengthen them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this second edition, the book has been significantly expanded to include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;New chapters on Web site architecture, security, reliability, and their impact on performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Detailed discussion of scalability of Java on multi-processor servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Perl scripts for writing web performance spiders that handle logins, cookies, SSL, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Detailed instructions on how to use Perl DBI and the open source program gnuplot to generate performance graphs on the fly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Coverage of rstat, a Unix-based open source utility for gathering performance statistics remotely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the book includes many more examples and graphs of real-world performance problems and their solutions, and has been updated for Java 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for anyone who has waited too long for a web page to display, or watched the servers they manage slow to a crawl. It's about making the Web more usable for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Perl Best Practices</title>
    <author>Damian Conway</author>
    <subjects>
      <subject>COMPUTERS</subject>
      <subject>Operating Systems</subject>
      <subject>UNIX</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many programmers code by instinct, relying on convenient habits or a "style" they picked up early on. They aren't conscious of all the choices they make, like how they format their source, the names they use for variables, or the kinds of loops they use. They're focused entirely on problems they're solving, solutions they're creating, and algorithms they're implementing. So they write code in the way that seems natural, that happens intuitively, and that feels good.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if you're serious about your profession, intuition isn't enough. &lt;i&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; author Damian Conway explains that rules, conventions, standards, and practices not only help programmers communicate and coordinate with one another, they also provide a reliable framework for thinking about problems, and a common language for expressing solutions. This is especially critical in Perl, because the language is designed to offer many ways to accomplish the same task, and consequently it supports many incompatible dialects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With a good dose of Aussie humor, Dr. Conway (familiar to many in the Perl community) offers 256 guidelines on the art of coding to help you write better Perl code--in fact, the best Perl code you possibly can. The guidelines cover code layout, naming conventions, choice of data and control structures, program decomposition, interface design and implementation, modularity, object orientation, error handling, testing, and debugging.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
They're designed to work together to produce code that is clear, robust, efficient, maintainable, and concise, but Dr. Conway doesn't pretend that this is the one true universal and unequivocal set of best practices. Instead, &lt;i&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; offers coherent and widely applicable suggestions based on real-world experience of how code is actually written, rather than on someone's ivory-tower theories on how
software ought to be created.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Most of all, &lt;i&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; offers guidelines that actually work, and that many developers around the world are already using. Much like Perl itself, these guidelines are about helping you to get your job done, without getting in the way.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Praise for &lt;i&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; from Perl community members:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"As a manager of a large Perl project, I'd ensure that every member of my team has a copy of &lt;i&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; on their desk, and use it as the basis for an in-house style guide."
-- Randal Schwartz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"There are no more excuses for writing bad Perl programs. All levels of Perl programmer will be more productive after reading this book."
-- Peter Scott&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"&lt;i&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; will be the next big important book in the evolution of Perl. The ideas and practices Damian lays down will help bring Perl out from under the embarrassing heading of "scripting languages". Many of us have known Perl is a real programming language, worthy of all the tasks normally delegated to Java and C++. With Perl Best Practices, Damian shows specifically how and why, so everyone else can see, too."
-- Andy Lester&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Damian's done what many thought impossible: show how to build large, maintainable Perl applications, while still letting Perl be the powerful, expressive language that programmers have loved for years."
-- Bill Odom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"Finally, a means to bring lasting order to the process and product of real Perl development teams."
-- Andrew Sundstrom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; provides a valuable education in how to write robust, maintainable Perl, and is a definitive citation source when coaching other programmers."
-- Bennett Todd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've been teaching Perl for years, and find the same question keeps being asked: Where can I find a reference for writing reusable, maintainable Perl code? Finally I have a decent answer."
-- Paul Fenwick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At last a well researched, well thought-out, comprehensive guide to Perl style. Instead of each of us developing our own, we can learn good practices from one of Perl's most prolific and experienced authors. I recommend this book to anyone who prefers getting on with the job rather than going back and fixing errors caused by syntax and poor style issues."
-- Jacinta Richardson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you care about programming in any language read this book. Even if you don't intend to follow all of the practices, thinking through your style will improve it."
-- Steven Lembark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The Perl community's best author is back with another outstanding book. There has never been a comprehensive reference on high quality Perl coding and style until &lt;i&gt;Perl Best Practices&lt;/i&gt;. This book fills a large gap in every Perl bookshelf."
-- Uri Guttman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Java and SOAP</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java and SOAP&lt;/i&gt; provides Java developers with an in-depth look at SOAP (the Simple Object Access Protocol).  Of course, it covers the basics: what SOAP is, why it's soared to a spot on the Buzzwords' Top Ten list, and what its features and capabilities are.  And it shows you how to work with some of the more common Java APIs in the SOAP world: Apache SOAP and GLUE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to covering the basics such as the structure of a SOAP message, SOAP encoding, and building simple services using RPC and messaging, Java and SOAP covers many topics that are essential to real-world development.  Although SOAP has native support for an impressive number of object types, the nature of modern programming means that whatever SOAP gives you is not enough.  When do you need to add support for your own object types, and how do you do it?  How do you handle errors, and how do you add your own information to Fault messages?  How do you handle attachments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, you could live entirely within Java, and ignore the SOAP messages being send back and forth: you'd be able to write Java code and let the SOAP APIs work behind the scenes.  However, we're not yet in that ideal world, and won't be for some time. Therefore, Java and SOAP pays particular attention to how SOAP messages are encoded.  It doesn't just explain the document types, but shows how the documents are used in practice as they are generated by the different APIs.  If you ever have to debug interoperability problems, you'll find that this information is indispensable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've always found that the best software is written by people who understand what's happening under the hood.  SOAP is no different.  Let's say you need to write a custom serializer to create a SOAP representation of a structure.  How do you know that your encoding is efficient?  There's one definitive answer: look at the SOAP documents it produces!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java and SOAP&lt;/i&gt; also discusses interoperability between the major SOAP platforms, including Microsoft's .NET, SOAP messaging, SOAP attachments, message routing, and a preview of the forthcoming AXIS APIs and server.  If you're a Java developer who would like to start working with SOAP, this is the book you need to get going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perl soared to popularity as a language for creating and managing web content, but with LWP (Library for WWW in Perl), Perl is equally adept at consuming information on the Web.  LWP is a suite of modules for fetching and processing web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web is a vast data source that contains everything from stock prices to movie credits, and with LWP all that data is just a few lines of code away.  Anything you do on the Web, whether it's buying or selling, reading or writing, uploading or downloading, news to e-commerce, can be controlled with Perl and LWP.  You can automate Web-based purchase orders as easily as you can set up a program to download MP3 files from a web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perl &amp;amp; LWP&lt;/i&gt; covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Understanding LWP and its design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Fetching and analyzing URLs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Extracting information from HTML using regular expressions and tokens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Working with the structure of HTML documents using trees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Setting and inspecting HTTP headers and response codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Managing cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Accessing information that requires authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Extracting links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Cooperating with proxy caches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Writing web spiders (also known as robots) in a safe fashion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perl &amp;amp; LWP&lt;/i&gt; includes many step-by-step examples that show how to apply the various techniques.  Programs to extract information from the web sites of BBC News, Altavista, ABEBooks.com, and the Weather Underground, to name just a few, are explained in detail, so that you understand how and why they work.
Perl programmers who want to automate and mine the web can pick up this book and be immediately productive.  Written by a contributor to LWP, and with a foreword by one of LWP's creators, &lt;i&gt;Perl &amp;amp; LWP&lt;/i&gt; is the authoritative guide to this powerful and popular toolkit.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The LWP (Library for WWW in Perl) suite of modules lets your programs download and extract information from the Web.  &lt;i&gt;Perl &amp;amp; LWP&lt;/i&gt; shows how to make web requests, submit forms, and even provide authentication information, and it demonstrates using regular expressions, tokens, and trees to parse HTML..  This book is a must have for Perl programmers who want to automate and mine the Web.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Learning Oracle PL/SQL</title>
    <author>Bill Pribyl, Steven Feuerstein</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PL/SQL, Oracle's programming language for stored procedures, delivers a world of possibilities for your database programs. PL/SQL supplements the standard relational database language, SQL, with a wide range of procedural features, including loops, IF-THEN statements, advanced data structures, and rich transactional control--all closely integrated with the Oracle database server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing where to start with Oracle's procedural language is not always obvious to a newcomer, especially considering the language's feature set and the sheer size of the official documentation (not to mention Oracle's ever-increasing number of pre-built PL/SQL programs).  But &lt;i&gt;Learning Oracle PL/SQL&lt;/i&gt; offers the signposts and guidance you need to come up to speed on the language, delivered in a manageable number of pages while covering all the essentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;PL/SQL--what is it, and why use it? Why use PL/SQL instead of Java?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Syntax and examples of all core language constructs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Creating, using, and reusing stored procedures, functions, and packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Building web-based applications using PL/SQL features available "out of the box" (such as PL/SQL Server Pages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Securing PL/SQL programs against attack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Benefits of third-party developer tools and integrated development environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Connecting PL/SQL to email, Java, and the Internet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meticulously crafted with all-new examples downloadable from &lt;a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/learnoracle/"&gt;examples.oreilly.com/learnoracle&lt;/a&gt;, the book addresses language features available in all versions of Oracle, from Oracle7 to Oracle8i to Oracle9i.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning Oracle PL/SQL&lt;/i&gt; was written by PL/SQL experts Bill Pribyl and Steven Feuerstein, whose easy-to-read style and attention to detail has made other O'Reilly books (such as the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Oracle PL/SQL Programming&lt;/i&gt;) very popular among Oracle developers worldwide. &lt;i&gt;Learning Oracle PL/SQL&lt;/i&gt; is meant for a wide range of target audiences, including both beginning programmers and those already experienced with other programming languages. Whether you are a new developer, a crossover programmer from another database system, or a new database administrator who needs to learn PL/SQL, this book will get you well on your way.  It is the perfect introduction to &lt;i&gt;Oracle PL/SQL Programming&lt;/i&gt;, also by Pribyl and Feuerstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed for both new programmers and those experienced in other languages, this book presents the core features of Oracle's PL/SQL language in an easy-to-read format. &lt;i&gt;Learning Oracle PL/SQL&lt;/i&gt; will bring programmers up to speed on the most important aspects of PL/SQL, including web and Internet programming. Updated through Oracle9i, includes sample programs downloadable from &lt;a href="http://examples.oreilly.com/learnoracle"&gt; examples.oreilly.com/learnoracle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, thousands of tools have been developed for debugging TCP/IP networks. They range from very specialized tools that do one particular task, to generalized suites that do just about everything except replace bad Ethernet cables. Even better, many of them are absolutely free. There's only one problem: who has time to track them all down, sort through them for the best ones for a particular purpose, or figure out how to use them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Network Troubleshooting Tools&lt;/i&gt; does the work for you--by describing the best of the freely available tools for debugging and troubleshooting. You can start with a lesser-known version of &lt;i&gt;ping&lt;/i&gt; that diagnoses connectivity problems, or take on a much more comprehensive program like MRTG for graphing traffic through network interfaces. There's &lt;i&gt;tkined&lt;/i&gt; for mapping and automatically monitoring networks, and Ethereal for capturing packets and debugging low-level problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book isn't just about the tools available for troubleshooting common network problems. It also outlines a systematic approach to network troubleshooting: how to document your network so you know how it behaves under normal conditions, and how to think about problems when they arise, so you can solve them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics covered in this book include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding your network
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connectivity testing
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluating the path between two network nodes
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tools for capturing packets
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tools for network discovery and mapping
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tools for working with SNMP
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance monitoring
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing application layer protocols
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Software sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're involved with network operations, this book will save you time, money, and needless experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Network Troubleshooting Tools&lt;/i&gt; helps you sort through the thousands of tools that have been developed for debugging TCP/IP networks and choose the ones that are best for your needs. It also shows you how to approach network troubleshooting using these tools, how to document your network so you know how it behaves under normal conditions, and how to think about problems when they arise so you can solve them more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Apache Cookbook</title>
    <author>Ken Coar, Rich Bowen</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache is far and away the most widely used web server platform in the world. Both free and rock-solid, it runs more than half of the world's web sites, ranging from huge e-commerce operations to corporate intranets and smaller hobby sites, and it continues to maintain its popularity, drawing new users all the time. If you work with Apache on a regular basis, you have plenty of documentation on installing and configuring your server, but where do you go for help with the day-to-day stuff, like adding common modules or fine-tuning your activity logging?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Apache Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of problems, solutions, and practical examples for webmasters, web administrators, programmers, and everyone else who works with Apache.  For every problem addressed in the book, there's a worked-out solution or "recipe"--short, focused pieces of code that you can use immediately. But this book offers more than cut-and-paste code. You also get explanations of how and why the code works, so you can adapt the problem-solving techniques to similar situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recipes in the &lt;i&gt;Apache Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; range from simple tasks, such installing the server on Red Hat Linux or Windows, to more complex tasks, such as setting up name-based virtual hosts or securing and managing your proxy server. The two hundred plus recipes in the book cover additional topics such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliases, Redirecting, and Rewriting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CGI Scripts, the suexec Wrapper, and other dynamic content techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error Handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's back to Columbia Internet, "the friendliest, hardest-working, and  most neurotic little Internet Service Provider in the world," for our  third installment from the hit online comic, &lt;i&gt;User Friendly.&lt;/i&gt; The  cast: Quake-obsessed techies, self-absorbed sales staff, well-meaning  execs, and assorted almost-humans. The background: too little office  space, warring operating systems, and eternally clueless customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tag along as geeks go camping, Mike finds a new use for silly putty, and  Stef decides to beef up his Quake skills with the Acme Forced-Feedback  Enemy-Denial Smackdown Ergonomic Game Chair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've read the first two &lt;i&gt;User Friendly&lt;/i&gt; editions from  O'Reilly, you don't need an introduction to Greg, Jeff, Miranda, the  Dust Puppy and the others. But if you haven't, welcome to the world of  the hard-core geek, where humor--especially at one's own foibles--can be  a survival skill. Since this is true of most work environments, chances  are you won't have to know Unix or be able to log in as "root" in order  to get the joke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illiad's community is truly global--the comic's one-million-plus readers  log on from Israel, Brazil, Iceland, New Zealand, and Greece, among  other far-flung locations. All kinds of people seem drawn to the strip-- from 8-year-old girls to 81-year-old women--a large, diverse, and very  loyal community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Korn shell is an interactive command and scripting language for accessing Unix&amp;#174; and other computer systems. As a complete and high-level programming language in itself, it's been a favorite since it was developed in the mid 1980s by David G. Korn at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Laboratories. Knowing how to use it is an essential skill for serious Unix users. &lt;i&gt;Learning the Korn Shell&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to use the Korn shell as a user interface and as a programming environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing applications is often easier and quicker with Korn than with other high-level languages. Because of this, the Korn shell is the most often used shell in commercial environments and among inexperienced users. There are two other widely used shells, the Bourne shell and the C shell. The Korn shell, or &lt;i&gt;ksh&lt;/i&gt;, has the best features of both, plus many new features of its own. &lt;i&gt;ksh&lt;/i&gt; can do much to enhance productivity and the quality of a user's work, both in interacting with the system, and in programming. The new version, &lt;i&gt;ksh93&lt;/i&gt;, has the functionality of other scripting languages such as awk, icon, Perl, rexx, and tcl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning the Korn Shell&lt;/i&gt; is the key to gaining control of the Korn shell and becoming adept at using it as an interactive command and scripting language. Prior programming experience is not required in order to understand the chapters on basic shell programming.  Readers will learn how to write many applications more easily and quickly than with other high-level languages. In addition, readers will also learn about Unix utilities and the way the Unix operating system works in general. The authors maintain that you shouldn't have to be an internals expert to use and program the shell effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second edition covers all the features of the current version of the Korn shell, including many new features not in earlier versions of ksh93, making it the most up-to-date reference available on the Korn shell. It compares the current version of the Korn shell to several other Bourne-compatible shells, including several Unix emulation environments for MS-DOS and Windows. In addition, it describes how to download and build ksh93 from source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid offering for many years, this newly revised title inherits a long tradition of trust among computer professionals who want to learn or refine an essential skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Programming Visual Basic for the Palm OS</title>
    <author>Matt Holmes, Patrick Burton, Roger Knoell</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the immense popularity of Palm OS devices, demand for Palm OS applications has increased dramatically. Over 16 million Palm Powered PDAs have sold over the past six years,and the number of registered Palm Developers is currently over 100,000 and growing by about a 1,000 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Basic is one of the most popular development platformsin the world. Until recently Visual Basic developers were not able to create applications for the Palm OS platform. By integrating into the Visual Basic environment, the AppForge Basic compiler has brought Palm development right into the main tool used by millions of VB Programmers. In fact, Visual Basic in conjunction with AppForge is fast becoming one of the favorite development environments for the Palm OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book provides a framework for application design, development and installation for the Palm handheld. While the reader should have experience with the property-method-event model of VB programming, no familiarity with Palm products is assumed or required. It is written primarily for corporate software developers, software architects, middle-ware developers and engineering managers who need to understand the strengths and limits of programming on the Palm, and how to integrate Visual Basic language Palm applications into their corporate IT infrastructure or product offerings. It teaches readers how to create a host of business applications including security, wireless and database connectivity programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the covered topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Complete coverage of Palm user interface and database programming techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Data Synchronization including how to build, test and install a conduit using Visual Basic and COM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Web Clipping applications and how to interface those applications to Microsoft's Active Server Page framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Extending the AppForge Palm application using shared libraries and Active-X like components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Visual Basic for the Palm OS&lt;/i&gt; is the only
book designed to help the Visual Basic desktop programmer to break into the Palm market. With &lt;i&gt;Programming Visual Basic for the Palm OS&lt;/i&gt;, Visual Basic programmers can become Palm programmers almost over night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Programming Jabber</title>
    <author>DJ Adams</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jabber is a set of protocols expressed in XML, and an extensible  framework that allows people and applications to exchange all  sorts of information, from simple text messages to being used to  extend the backbone of an enterprise data system. Jabber gives you  the power to build applications that have identity, presence, and  that can take part in &lt;i&gt;conversations&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Jabber&lt;/i&gt; offers developers a chance to learn and  understand the Jabber technology and protocol from an implementer's  point of view. Detailed information of each part of the Jabber  protocol is introduced, explained, and discussed in the form of  mini-projects, or simple and extended examples. &lt;i&gt;Programming  Jabber&lt;/i&gt; provides this foundation by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Showing you how to install and configure the Jabber server
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Providing a detailed overview of the server  architecture and configuration options
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covering the core Jabber technologies such as XML streams and Jabber identifiers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Referencing all of Jabber's XML namespaces
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examining the client registration and authentication phases
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Showing how to deploy your own Jabber-based messaging solutions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrating how to embed XML-RPC-style call mechanisms into Jabber
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Jabber&lt;/i&gt; is divided into two parts. The first part  serves as an introduction to Jabber; you'll learn about its features,  why it's more than an IM system, and how to install and configure a  Jabber server of your own. The second part provides detailed information  about the Jabber protocol, and a series of practical examples, which can  be used to solve everyday problems. The examples, in Perl, Python, and Java,  use various Jabber features as a way of illustrating parts of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Jabber&lt;/i&gt; provides the foundation and framework for  developers to hit the ground running, and is &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; essential book  on Jabber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Apache: The Definitive Guide</title>
    <author>Ben Laurie, Peter Laurie</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache is far and away the most widely used web server platform in the world. This versatile server runs more than half of the world's existing web sites. Apache is both free and rock-solid, running more than 21 million web sites ranging from huge e-commerce operations to corporate intranets and smaller hobby sites.&lt;/p&gt;

      <subject>XML</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XML is a text-based markup language that has taken the programming world by storm.  More powerful than HTML yet less demanding than SGML, XML has proven itself to be flexible and resilient.  XML is the perfect tool for formatting documents with even the smallest bit of complexity, from Web pages to legal contracts to books.  However, XML has also proven itself to be indispensable for organizing and conveying other sorts of data as well, thus its central role in web services like SOAP and XML-RPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Perl programming language was tailor-made for manipulating text, few people have disputed the fact that Perl and XML are perfectly suited for one another.  The only question has been what's the best way to do it. That's where this book comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perl &amp;amp; XML&lt;/i&gt; is aimed at Perl programmers who need to work with XML documents and data. The book covers all the major modules for XML processing in Perl, including XML::Simple, XML::Parser, XML::LibXML, XML::XPath, XML::Writer, XML::Pyx, XML::Parser::PerlSAX, XML::SAX, XML::SimpleObject, XML::TreeBuilder, XML::Grove, XML::DOM, XML::RSS, XML::Generator::DBI, and SOAP::Lite. But this book is more than just a listing of modules; it gives a complete, comprehensive tour of the landscape of Perl and XML, making sense of the myriad of modules, terminology, and techniques.
This book covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;parsing XML documents and writing them out again&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type="disc"&gt;working with event streams and SAX&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type="disc"&gt;tree processing and the Document Object Model&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type="disc"&gt;advanced tree processing with XPath and XSLT
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Most valuably, the last two chapters of Perl &amp;amp; XML give complete examples of XML applications, pulling together all the tools at your disposal. All together, &lt;i&gt;Perl &amp;amp; XML&lt;/i&gt; is the single book that gives you a solid grounding in XML processing with Perl.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Programming Web Services with Perl</title>
    <author>Randy J. Ray, Pavel Kulchenko</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given Perl's natural fit for web applications development, it's no surprise that Perl is also a natural choice for web services development. It's the most popular web programming language, with strong implementations of both SOAP and XML-RPC, the leading ways to distribute applications using web services. But books on web services focus on writing these applications in Java or Visual Basic, leaving Perl programmers with few resources to get them started. &lt;i&gt;Programming Web Services with Perl&lt;/i&gt; changes that, bringing Perl users all the information they need to create web services using their favorite language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Web Services with Perl&lt;/i&gt; steers clear of the hype surrounding web services and concentrates on what is useful and practical. The book introduces the major web services standards, such as XML-RPC, SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI, and shows how to implement Perl servers and clients using these standards. You'll find detailed references on both the XML and SOAP toolkits, and learn when to use one technology in favor of the other. The book is rich with programming examples that you'll find useful well past the learning stage. And, moving beyond the basics, the book offers solutions to problems of security, authentication, and scalability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics covered in the book are:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HTTP and XML basics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML-RPC and the toolkits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOAP and toolkits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOAP::Lite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using SOAP with SMTP and other protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertising and discovering with UDDI and WSDL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The REST methodology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The future of web services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Web Services with Perl&lt;/i&gt; was written for Perl programmers who have no prior knowledge of web services. You can pick up this book without any understanding of XML-RPC or SOAP and be able to apply these technologies easily, through the use of publicly available Perl modules detailed in the book.
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in applying XML-RPC and SOAP technologies to distributed programming applications, then &lt;i&gt;Programming Web Services with Perl&lt;/i&gt; is a book you'll want to have. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <author>Andy Duncan, Jared Still</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perl is a very powerful tool for Oracle database administrators, but too few DBAs realize how helpful Perl can be in managing, monitoring, and tuning Oracle databases.  Whether you're responsible for Oracle9i, Oracle8i, or earlier databases, you'll find Perl an invaluable addition to your database administration arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to be a Perl expert to use the excellent applications and scripts described in Perl for Oracle DBAs. The book explains what you need to know about Perl, provides a wealth of ready-to-use scripts developed especially for Oracle DBAs, and suggests many resources for further exploration. The book covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Perl language -- an introduction to Perl, its rich history and culture, and its extensive text processing and data transformation capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Perl/Oracle architecture -- Detailed information about Perl DBI, DBD::Oracle, the Oracle Call Interface (OCI), Oracle::OCI, extproc_perl, and mod_perl, the modules that allow Perl programs to communicate with Oracle databases.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Perl applications for Oracle DBAs -- Profiles of the best Perl open source applications available for use and customization by Oracle DBAs: Perl/Tk, OraExplain, StatsView, Orac, DDL::Oracle, SchemaDiff, Senora, DBD::Chart, SchemaView-Plus, Oracletool, Karma, Embperl, and Mason.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Perl Database Administration (PDBA) Toolkit -- a comprehensive suite of specialized, ready-to-use scripts designed to help Oracle DBAs perform both routine and  special-purpose administrative tasks: monitoring the Oracle alert log and databases, creating and managing Oracle user accounts, maintaining  indexes and extents, extracting DDL and data, troubleshooting and tuning database problems, and much more.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The book also explains how Oracle DBAs and developers can extend the toolkit and solve their own database administration problems using Perl.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySQL is a popular and robust open source database product that  supports key subsets of SQL on both Linux and Unix systems. MySQL  is free for nonprofit use and costs a small amount for commercial  use. Unlike commercial databases, MySQL is affordable and easy  to use. This book includes introductions to SQL and to relational  database theory. If you plan to use MySQL to build web sites or  other Linux or Unix applications, this book teaches you to do that,  and it will remain useful as a reference once you understand the  basics. Ample tutorial material and examples are included throughout.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book has all you need to take full advantage of this powerful  database management system. It takes you through the whole process  from installation and configuration to programming interfaces and  database administration. This second edition has a greatly enhanced  administration chapter that includes information on administrative  tools, server configuration, server startup and shutdown, log file  management, database backup and restore, and database administration  and repair. In addition, a new chapter on security describes data,  server, and client-server security, while a chapter on extending  MySQL provides an overview of MySQL internals and describes the use  of MySQL user-defined functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you know C/C++, Java, Perl, PHP, or Python, you can write programs  to interact with your MySQL database. In addition, you can embed queries  and updates directly in an HTML file so that a web page becomes its own  interface to the database. Managing and Using MySQL includes chapters on  the programming language interfaces, and it also includes a complete  reference section with specific function calls for each language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also included in the reference section are references to the SQL language,  and details of the MySQL system variables, programs, and utilities.  New to the second edition is a reference to the internal MySQL tables,  which will be of particular interest to those who want to work extensively  with MySQL security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how to use MySQL, a popular database product that supports key subsets of SQL on Linux and Unix systems. Using C/C++, Java, Perl, PHP, or Python, you can write programs to interact with a MySQL database, either as a stand-alone application or through a web page. This book covers the whole process, from installation to programming interfaces and database administration. It includes ample tutorial material and examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postfix is a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA): software that mail servers use to route email. Postfix is highly respected by experts for its secure design and tremendous reliability. And new users like it because it's so simple to configure. In fact, Postfix has been adopted as the default MTA on Mac OS X. It is also compatible with sendmail, so that existing scripts and programs continue to work seamlessly
after it is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postfix was written by well-known security expert Wietse Venema, who reviewed this book intensively during its entire development. Author Kyle Dent covers a wide range of Postfix tasks, from virtual hosting to controls for unsolicited commercial email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While basic configuration of Postfix is easy, every site has unique needs that call for a certain amount of study. This book, with careful background explanations and generous examples, eases readers from the basic configuration to the full power of Postfix. It discusses the Postfix interfaces to various tools that round out a fully scalable and highly secure email system.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruby is an absolutely pure object-oriented scripting language  written in C and designed with Perl and Python capabilities in  mind.  While its roots are in Japan, Ruby is slowly but surely  gaining ground in the US.  The goal of Yukihiro Matsumoto,  creator of Ruby and author of this book, is to incorporate  the strengths of languages like Perl, Python, Lisp and Smalltalk. Ruby is a genuine attempt to combine the best of everything  in the scripting world.  Since 1993, Ruby mailing lists have  been established, Web pages have formed, and a community has  grown around it.  The language itself is very good at text  processing and is notable for its broad object orientation.   Ruby is portable and runs under GNU/Linux (and other Unices)  as well as DOS, MS Windows and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Ruby in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, Matsumoto offers a practical  reference to the features of this new language including the  command-line options, syntax, built-in variables, functions,  and many commonly used classes and modules.  This guide covers the  current stable version of Ruby (1.6), yet is applicable to the  development version 1.7 and the next planned stable version 1.8.   You will find a thorough description of Ruby's language syntax, and a description of the core functionality  built into the standard Ruby interpreter, which has more  than 800 built-in methods in 42 classes and modules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby finds its power through its built-in libraries, and this handy  volume take you through the many useful libraries that come with the standard Ruby distribution--from network access via HTTP and CGI programming, to data persistence using the DBM library.  This book concludes with  coverage of the unique tools that come with Ruby, including the debugger, profiler, and irb (or interactive ruby.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out how Ruby combines the strengths of other languages,   and why it has captured the interest of so many open source   programmers.  As part of the successful "in a nutshell" series of books from O'Reilly &amp;amp; Associates, Ruby in a Nutshell is for readers who want a single desktop reference for all their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web developers rely on XML to separate data from presentation and create a consistent templating system for a web site.  Although limited XML-to-HTML conversion is possible within some browsers, web developers creating dynamic or complex sites will find server-side XML transformation a necessity. Unfortunately, until recently, there have been few XML tools available for server-side XML transformation or authoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AxKit, a mod_perl and Apache-based XML content delivery solution, was designed to meet that need with a cost-effective and efficient plugin architecture. AxKit allows the developer to quickly design modules to create faster web sites, and deliver them in a wide variety of media formats. AxKit also takes care of caching so the developer doesn't have to worry about it. AxKit meets the demands of the web developer nicely, but, as with any new toolkit, there is a learning curve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers who want to flatten that learning curve and get right to work with AxKit, &lt;i&gt;XML Publishing with AxKit&lt;/i&gt; provides detailed information on how to install, configure, and deploy AxKit effectively. The first book solely devoted to AxKit, &lt;i&gt;XML Publishing with AxKit&lt;/i&gt; also offers a concise and focused look at how to create XSLT and XPathScript-based pipelines for XML data transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solidly useful new book presents web programmers with the hands-on knowledge they need to get really creative with AxKit. It features a thorough introduction to XSP (extensible Server Pages), which applies the concepts of Server Pages technologies (embedded code, tag libraries, etc) to the XML world, and covers integrating AxKit with other tools such as Template Toolkit, Apache:: Mason, Apache::ASP, and plain CGI. The book also includes invaluable reference sections on configuration directives, XPathScript, and XSP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;XML Publishing with AxKit&lt;/i&gt;, web developers will have all the tools they need to deliver complex XML-based systems quickly, the power to develop their own systems for style sheet negotiation, and the flexibility to design completely new style sheet languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;XML Publishing with AxKit&lt;/i&gt; gives those new to XML all the background and the courage they need to jump right in and deploy AxKit. And it gives XML-savvy professionals everything they need to hit the ground running. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graphics programmers aren't the only ones who need to be proficient with graphics. Web and applications programmers know that a dull web page can be quickly transformed into one that's interesting and lively with the use of well-planned graphics. And fortunately, you don't need the skills of a fulltime graphics programmer to use graphics effectively. From access counters and log report graphs to scientific plots and on-the-fly animated GIFs, graphics scripting is within the grasp of most web programmers.  Using open source software, like Perl, you have the power to dynamically generate graphics based on user input and activity, easily manipulate graphics content, and optimize graphics for compression and quality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geared toward Perl users and webmasters, &lt;i&gt;Perl Graphics Programming&lt;/i&gt; focuses on open-source scripting programs that manipulate graphics files for use on the Web.  The book demystifies the manipulation of graphics formats for newcomers to the Web with a practical, resource-like approach.  With this book you'll learn to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generate dynamic web graphics with charts, tables, and buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate graphics tasks (thumbnails and borders)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create dynamics web documents (PDF, Postscript)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Produce rich Internet experiences with Flash and SVG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
You'll begin with a tour of the most common web graphic file formats--PNG, JPEG, GIF, SWF, SVG, Postscript and PDF--then you'll explore the most powerful tools and Perl modules available for manipulating these graphics, such as GD, PerlMagick, and GIMP. Included in this part of the book is a thorough description of the Ming module for creating on-the-fly Flash files. Next, a "cookbook" section includes practical, all purpose recipes: GIF animation, generating images within a dynamic application, communicating between SWF front-end and Perl back-end, XSLT transformations, compression, and much more.
&lt;p&gt;Perl programmers naturally turn to Perl to tackle whatever challenge they have at hand, and graphics programming is no exception.  &lt;i&gt;Perl Graphics Programming&lt;/i&gt; provides all the tools you need to begin programming and designing graphics for the Web immediately. This book will change how you think about generating and manipulating graphics for the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scalable Vector Graphics -- or SVG -- is the new XML-based graphics standard from the W3C that will enable Web documents to be smaller, faster and more interactive. J. David Eisenberg's insightful book takes you through the ins and outs of SVG, beginning with basics needed to create simple line drawings and then moving through more complicated features like filters, transformations, and integration with Java, Perl, and XSLT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike GIFs, JPEGs or PNGs (which are bitmapped), SVG images are both resolution- and device-independent, so that they can scale up or down to fit proportionally into any size display or any Internet device -- from PDAs to large office monitors and high-resolution printers. Smaller than bitmapped files and faster to download, SVG images can be rendered with different CSS styles for each environment. They work well across a range of available bandwidths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SVG makes it possible for designers to escape the constant need to update graphics by hand or use custom code to generate bitmap images. And while SVG was created with the Web in mind, the language has a variety of other uses. SVG greatly simplifies tasks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Creating web sites whose graphics reflect the content of the page, changing automatically if the content changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Generating graphs and charts from information stored in a wide variety of sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Exchanging detailed drawings, from architectural plans to CAD layouts to project management diagrams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Creating diagrams that users can explore by zooming in and panning around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Generating bitmap images for use in older browsers using simple automatable templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Managing graphics that support multiple languages or translations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="?disc?"&gt;Creating complex animation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By focusing sharply on the markup at the foundation of SVG, &lt;i&gt;SVG Essentials&lt;/i&gt; gives you a solid base on which to create your own custom tools.  Explanations of key technical tools -- like XML, matrix math, and scripting -- are included as appendices, along with a reference to the SVG vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a graphic designer in search of new tools or a programmer dealing with the complex task of creating and managing graphics, SVG Essentials provides you with the means to take advantage of SVG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a developer new to Web Services, how do you make sense of this emerging framework so you can start writing your own services today?  This concise book gives programmers both a concrete introduction and a handy reference to XML web services, first by explaining the foundations of this new breed of distributed services, and then by demonstrating quick ways to create services with open-source Java tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Services make it possible for diverse applications to discover each other and exchange data seamlessly via the Internet.  For instance, programs written in Java and running on Solaris can find and call code written in C# that run on Windows XP, or programs written in Perl that run on Linux, without any concern about the details of how that service is implemented. A common set of Web Services is at the core of Microsoft's new .NET strategy, Sun Microsystems's Sun One Platform, and the W3C's XML Protocol Activity Group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, author Ethan Cerami explores four key emerging technologies:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;XML Remote Procedure Calls (XML-RPC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;SOAP - The foundation for most commercial Web Services development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Universal Discovery, Description and Integration (UDDI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Web Services Description Language (WSDL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
For each of these topics, &lt;i&gt;Web Services Essentials &lt;/i&gt;provides a quick overview, Java tutorials with sample code, samples of the XML documents underlying the service, and explanations of freely-available Java APIs.  Cerami also includes a guide to the current state of Web Services, pointers to open-source tools and a comprehensive glossary of terms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to break through the Web Services hype and find useful information on these evolving technologies, look no further than &lt;i&gt;Web Services Essentials. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mason doesn't aim to be the one true Perl-based templating system for building web sites, but it's led many programmers to abandon their custom solutions when they've seen how much easier using Mason can be. It's a powerful, open source, Perl-based web site development and delivery engine, with features that make it an ideal backend for high load sites serving dynamic content.  Mason uses a concept called components: a mix of HTML, Perl, and special Mason commands. These components can be entire web pages, or bits of HTML that can be embedded in top-level components.  Shared and reusable, these components greatly simplify site maintenance: when you change a shared component, you instantly change all pages that refer to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although using Mason isn't difficult, creating a Mason-based site can be tricky. &lt;i&gt;Embedding Perl in HTML with Mason&lt;/i&gt;, written by members of Mason's core development team, shows you how to take advantage of Mason's strengths while avoiding the obstacles that inexperienced users may encounter.  Mason's unique features, when used properly, can streamline the design of a web site or application.  This concise book covers these features from several angles, and includes a study of the authors' sample site where these features are used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Embedding Perl in HTML with Mason&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to create large, complex, dynamically driven web sites that look good and are a snap to maintain. You'll learn how to visualize multiple Mason-based solutions to any given problem and select among them. The book covers the latest line of Mason development 1.1x, which has many new features, including line number reporting based on source files, sub-requests, and easier use as a CGI.  The only book to cover this important tool, &lt;i&gt;Embedding Perl in HTML with Mason&lt;/i&gt; is essential reading for any Perl programmer who wants to simplify web site design. Learn how to use Mason, and you'll spend more time making things work, and less time reinventing the wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;mod_perl embeds the popular programming language Perl in the Apache web server, giving rise to a fast and powerful web programming environment.  &lt;i&gt;Practical mod_perl&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive book on how to use, optimize, and troubleshoot mod_perl.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
New mod_perl users will learn how to quickly and easily get mod_perl compiled and installed. But the primary purpose of this book is to show you how to take full advantage of mod_perl: how to make a mod_perl-enabled Web site as fast, flexible, and easily-maintainable as possible.  The authors draw from their own personal experience in the field, as well as the combined experience of the mod_perl community, to present a rich and complete picture of how to set up and maintain a successful mod_perl site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book is also the first book to cover the "next generation" of mod_perl:  mod_perl 2.0, a completely rewritten version of mod_perl designed for integration with Apache 2.0, which for the first time supports threads.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The book covers the following topics, and more:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configuring mod_perl optimally for your web site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Porting and optimizing programs for a mod_perl environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance tuning: getting the very fastest performance from your site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling and monitoring the server to circumvent crashes and clogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating with databases efficiently and painlessly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging tips and tricks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximizing security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Written for Perl web developers and web administrators, &lt;i&gt;Practical mod_perl&lt;/i&gt; is an extensive guide to the nuts and bolts of the powerful and popular combination of Apache and mod_perl. From writing and debugging scripts to keeping your server running without failures, the techniques in this book will help you squeeze every ounce of power out of your server.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;DNS on Windows 2000&lt;/i&gt; is a special Windows-oriented edition of the  classic &lt;i&gt;DNS and BIND.&lt;/i&gt; The Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the  Internet's fundamental building blocks: the distributed host information  database that's responsible for translating names into addresses,  routing mail to its proper destination, and many other services. As the  preface says, if you're using the Internet, you're already using  DNS--even if you don't know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides covering general issues like installing, setting up, and  maintaining the server, &lt;i&gt;DNS on Windows 2000&lt;/i&gt; tackles those  specific to the Windows environment: integration between DNS and Active  Directory, conversion from BIND to the Microsoft DNS server, and  registry settings. You'll also acquire a grounding in:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Security issues
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;System tuning
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Caching
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Zone change notification
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Troubleshooting
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Planning for growth
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a Windows administrator, &lt;i&gt;DNS on Windows 2000&lt;/i&gt; is the  operations manual you need for working with DNS every day; if you're a  Windows user who simply wants to take the mystery out of the Internet,  this book is a readable introduction to the Internet's architecture and  inner workings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;What DNS does, how it works, and when you need to use it
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How to find your own place in the Internet's namespace
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Setting up name servers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Integrating Active Directory with DNS
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Dynamic updates, storing zone information in Active  Directory, and incremental zone transfers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Using MX records to route mail
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Configuring hosts to use name servers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Subdividing domains (parenting)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Securing your name server: preventing unauthorized zone  transfers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Mapping one name to several servers for load sharing
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Troubleshooting: using nslookup, diagnosing common  problems
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This special Windows-oriented edition of the classic &lt;i&gt;DNS and BIND&lt;/i&gt; is a guide to one of the Internet's fundamental building blocks: the distributed host information database responsible for translating names into addresses, routing mail, and many other services.

    <title>Oracle RMAN Pocket Reference</title>
    <author>Darl Kuhn, Scott Schulze</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oracle RMAN Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is a handy guide  for DBAs who intend to use Oracle Recovery Manager  for database backup and recovery. Because Recovery  Manager (RMAN) is a relatively new tool, many DBAs  are just becoming familiar with it. They will welcome  a timely book that explains clearly and concisely how  to use RMAN for common backup and recovery tasks that  are infrequent, yet extremely vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first portion of the book is primarily task-oriented.  After a short section on RMAN architecture, the book  shows (in checklist style) how to perform common backup  and recovery tasks such as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Implementing a recovery catalog
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Creating and running RMAN scripts
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Configuring input/output channels
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Taking a full database backup
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Backing up tablespaces and datafiles
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Taking incremental backups
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Recovering lost datafiles
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second portion of the book consists of a handy  syntax reference to the many RMAN commands. Having  a quick reference to RMAN commands is a great  convenience to DBAs who otherwise, often under the  pressure of a recovery situation, would have to wade  through Oracle's online documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oracle RMAN Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is ideal for DBAs who require a concise reference to common RMAN tasks. The first portion of the book presents commands for such tasks as taking a full database backup, recovering from loss of data file, and cloning a database. The second portion offers a very concise RMAN syntax reference. This book will save DBAs time when performing tasks that are infrequent, yet extremely vital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Building Cocoa Applications: A Step by Step Guide</title>
    <author>Simson Garfinkel, Michael Mahoney</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocoa is an object-oriented development environment available in Apple's Mac OS X environment. Mac OS X, a unified operating system and graphical operating  environment, is the fastest growing Unix variant on the market today. Hard-core Unix programmers, developers who cut their teeth on classic Mac operating systems, and developers who cherished NeXTSTEP, the decade-old system on which today's Cocoa is based -- all are flocking to Cocoa, and they need a lot more practical information than is currently available from Apple. There is a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Building Cocoa Applications&lt;/i&gt; is an ideal book for serious developers who want to write programs for the Mac OS X using Cocoa.  It's a no-nonsense, hands-on text that's filled with examples -- not only simple and self-contained examples of individual Cocoa features, but extended examples of complete applications with enough sophistication and complexity that readers can put them to immediate use in their own environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Building Cocoa Applications&lt;/i&gt; takes a step-by-step approach to teaching developers how to build real graphics applications using Cocoa. By showing the basics of an application in one chapter and then layering additional functionality onto that application in subsequent chapters, the book keeps readers interested and motivated. Readers will see immediate results, and then go on to build onto what they've already achieved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into four major parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part I introduces the Mac OS X graphical user interface (Aqua) from a developer's point of view, Cocoa developer tools (such as the Interface Builder, Project Builder,
and gdb debugger), object-oriented concepts, the Objective-C language in which Cocoa is written, and the basics of Cocoa programming itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part II focuses on building the first complete application, Calculator, a simple four-function calculator. The chapters in this part of the book extend the application, piece by piece, by introducing such features as nibs, icons, delegation, resizing, events, and responders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part III focuses on building an application called MathPaper, which is similar to a word processor but which instead solves mathematical expressions the user supplies. The chapters in this part of the book extend MathPaper by developing both the front and back ends using a variety of Cocoa classes and methods. They introduce Cocoa'sdocument-based architecture, tasks, pipes, Rich Text format, handling document files, and using Quartz to draw in windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part IV focuses on building the GraphPaper application, a more complex multithreading application that graphs mathematical functions in multiple dimensions and
that uses mouse-over capabilities to identify graph points. The chapters in this part of the book add more advanced Mac OS X features such as multithreading, color,
mouse events, zoom buttons, pasteboards, services, preferences, and the defaults database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the book, readers who have built the applications as they have read will have a solid understanding of what it really means to develop complete and incrementally more complex Cocoa applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book comes with extensive source code available for download from the O'Reilly web site, along with an appendix listing additional resources for further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott Oaks, lead author of O'Reilly's new &lt;i&gt;JXTA in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; says,"Fundamental scalability and centralization forces are constraining the Internet and are restricting its growth. Peer-to-peer networks like JXTA are essential to bring the internet to the next level of scalability, management and security in order to handle unconstrained exchanges of information between peers and the wave of new consumer devices."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by the key members of Sun Microsystem's Project JXTA, &lt;i&gt;JXTA in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive reference to the most solid platform yet for Peer-to-Peer distributed computing. "P2P" enables users with the same networking application to connect with each other and directly access files from one another's hard drives. JXTA is a giant step forward in the evolution of P2P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly's pioneering reference is the first and last word on this powerful distributed computing technology. &lt;i&gt;JXTA in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; delivers all the information you need to get started, including an overview of P2P distributed computing, an explanation of the JXTA Project's new platform, and ways that developers can become a part of the development effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JXTA in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; introduces major concepts in a hands-on way by explaining them in context to the shell, and contains a complete reference to the JXTA application bindings. Also included is the full JXTA protocol specification. The book covers important topics such as security, and how the JXTA technology fits into the standard Java classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>SAX2</title>

      <subject>General</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concise book gives you the information you need to effectively use the Simple API for XML (SAX2), the dominant API for efficient XML processing with Java. With the SAX2 API, developers have access to the information in XML documents as they are read, without imposing major memory constraints or a large code footprint.  SAX2 is often used by other APIs "under the covers", and provides a foundation for processing and creating both XML and non-XML information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While generally considered the most efficient approach to handling XML document parsing, SAX2 also carries a significant learning curve. In &lt;i&gt;SAX2&lt;/i&gt;, author David Brownell explores the many details of managing XML parsers, filtering the information those parsers return, generating
your own SAX2 events to convert non-XML information to an XML form, and developing strategies for using event-based parsing in a variety of application scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in a public process by the XML-Dev mailing list, the SAX2 API is compact and highly functional. SAX2 uses callbacks to report the information in an XML document as the document is read, allowing you to create your own
program structures around the content of documents. No intermediary model of an entire XML document is necessary, and the mapping from XML structures to Java structures and back is straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both developers learning about SAX2 for the first time and developers returning for reference and advanced material about SAX2 will find useful information in this book. Chapters provide detailed explanations and examples of many different aspects of SAX2 development, while appendices provide a reference to the API and an explanation of the relationships between the SAX2 API and the XML Information Set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the core of the API is quite approachable, many of its more advanced features are both obscure and powerful. You can use SAX2 to filter, modify, and restructure
information in layers of processing which make it easy to reuse generic tools. SAX2 also has some significant limitations that applications need to address in their
own ways. This new book gives you the detail and examples required to use SAX2 to its full potential, taking advantage of its power while avoiding its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This complete guide to the Perl programming language ranges widely through the Perl programmer's universe, gathering together in a convenient form a wealth of information about Perl itself and its application to CGI scripts, XML processing, network programming, database interaction, and graphical user interfaces. The book is an ideal reference for experienced Perl programmers and beginners alike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more than a million dedicated programmers, Perl is proving to be the best language for the latest trends in computing and business, including network programming and the ability to create and manage web sites. It's a language that every Unix system administrator and serious web developer needs to know. In the past few years, Perl has found its way into complex web applications of multinational banks, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and hundreds of large corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this second edition, &lt;i&gt;Perl in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; has been expanded to include coverage of Perl 5.8, with information on Unicode processing in Perl, new functions and modules that have been added to the core language, and up-to-date details on running Perl on the Win32 platform.  The book also covers Perl modules for recent technologies such as XML and SOAP.&lt;/p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning Wireless Java&lt;/i&gt; is for Java developers who want to quickly come up to speed and create applications for the Micro Edition audience. This book covers the Connected, Limited Device Configuration and the Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP), both currently available from Javasoft. The CLDC contains APIs for small devices that are constrained by both memory and processing power. MIDP builds on top of the CLDC and adds APIs specifically for devices such as mobile phones and pagers, allowing programmers to create MIDlet applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book offers a solid introduction to J2ME and MIDP, including an explanation of the J2ME Wireless Toolkit, the MIDlet lifecycle methods, the Java application manager, and the CLDC and MIDP constraints. In addition, we cover the javax.microedition.io, javax.microedition.rms, javax.microedition.lcdui, and javax.microedition.midlet classes, as well as the modified java.lang, java.io, and java.util classes. Discussion centers around building safe, compact applications with the sophisticated graphical interface, database, and networking capabilities that the J2ME supports. In addition, this book also shows you how to download your applications to the latest J2ME-enabled devices, including the Motorola i50x and i85s phones and upgraded Palm handhelds.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <title>BEEP:  The Definitive Guide</title>
    <author>Marshall Rose</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need to design a protocol that really fits your application, you want BEEP--an integrated collection of building blocks that gives you "best in class" data transmission solutions for everything from framing to security. Whether you're writing a simple "fetch" client/server application or a multi-threaded peer-to-peer relaying system, BEEP provides the necessary functionality without extra overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BEEP gives network developers what they've long needed: a standard toolkit for building protocols quickly and conveniently. For the first time, it's possible to create an application protocol that's tightly tuned to the application's requirements, so you can avoid reinventing the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by BEEP creator Marshall Rose, &lt;i&gt;BEEP: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; is the only book on the subject--a compendium straight from the horse's mouth. This book shows you what BEEP is for and, more important, how to put it to use. After explaining concepts underlying the BEEP protocol, Rose shows you how to use the BEEP implementation in Java, C, and Tcl. You'll learn to build several working applications that use BEEP as a transport, including an implementation of the reliable SYSLOG protocol and an implementation of a BEEP transport for SOAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BEEP was standardized in 2001, different groups are already using it for SOAP exchanges, intrusion detection, instant messaging, network auditing, remote calendaring, and secure credential exchange. These groups work on different problems, but what they have in common is a simple desire to focus on the problem domain instead of the tedious details of protocol overhead. If you're a network developer, you need to become familiar with this important new tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Perry has spent his time "in the trenches".  "I've been paged at 3:00 am to provide support because the system wasn't doing what it should and no one had a clue how to figure out why.  I've scrolled through endless logfiles to decipher system problems, when a management solution could have presented an operator with a warning message hours earlier!"   Wanting other developers to be able to learn from his experiences, Steve wrote &lt;i&gt;Java Management Extensions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Management Extensions&lt;/i&gt; is a practical, hands-on guide to using the JMX APIs, Sun Microsystem's new Java-based tool for managing enterprise applications.  This one-of-a kind book is a complete treatment of the JMX architecture (both the instrumentation level and the agent level), and it's loaded with real-world examples for implementing Management Extensions.  It also contains useful information at the higher level about JMX (the "big picture") to help technical managers and architects who are evaluating various application management approaches and are considering JMX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JMX technology is very new, and according to Steve, still has a few "potholes" in it.  This book takes developers through it step by step, pointing out the "gotchas" before they have a chance to trip up smooth operation of the application.  The author, a member of the expert group developing the JMX specification, points out that as J2EE becomes more widely adopted, the Java standard for management (JMX) becomes more and more crucial to avoid "splinter standards" where each vendor has their own distinct, arguably successful, way of doing things.  "In my own company we have already identified and are tackling the problem of managing our Java applications.  It's my belief that other companies will follow, as they come to realize the power that a standard manageability solution (ie, JMX) gives them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into the following sections:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
Part I: &lt;li type="disc"&gt;Introduction and overview&lt;/li&gt;
Part II: &lt;li type="disc"&gt;the JMX Instrumentation Level&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li type="disc"&gt;Standard MBeans&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li type="disc"&gt;Dynamic MBeans&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li type="disc"&gt;Model Mbeans&lt;/li&gt;
Part III: &lt;li type="disc"&gt;The JMX Agent Level&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li type="disc"&gt;The Mbean Server&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li type="disc"&gt;The JMX Notification Model&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li type="disc"&gt;Dynamic Loading&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li type="disc"&gt;Monitors&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li type="disc"&gt;Timer Services  &lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language written in 100% pure Java, so it runs under any compliant Java Virtual Machine. The secret to Jython's popularity lies in the combination of Java's libraries
and tools with Python's rapid development capabilities. With Jython, you can write Python programs that integrate seamlessly with any Java code. And like Python, Jython can be used interactively, so you can get immediate results as you are programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jython Essentials&lt;/i&gt; provides a solid introduction to the Python language, offering a brief but thorough tour of the Python concepts you'll need to understand to use Jython effectively.  The book makes frequent comparisons
between Python and Java, with special emphasis on the different object-oriented semantics of the two languages, so Java programmers can quickly get up to speed with Jython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jython Essentials&lt;/i&gt; also covers the various ways in which Jython and Java can interact.  For example, Jython code can create instances of pre-existing Java classes and call methods in those instances.  You can write Jython classes that are direct subclasses of existing Java classes
and use introspection to discern the capabilities of JavaBeans components.  This book provides examples of using Jython with existing Java libraries, including the Swing GUI toolkit, the JDBC database API, the Servlet API, and various XML tools.  And finally, the book shows how
Jython can be used as a scripting language within a Java program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Jython Essentials&lt;/i&gt;, you have everything you need to start creating applications that mix the best of Python's interactivity and Java's robust libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web services are poised to become a key technology for a wide range of Internet-enabled applications, spanning everything from straight B2B systems to mobile devices and proprietary in-house software.  While there are several tools and platforms that can be used for building web services, developers are finding a powerful tool in Microsoft's .NET Framework and Visual Studio .NET.  Designed from scratch to support the development of web services, the .NET Framework simplifies the process--programmers find that tasks that took an hour using the SOAP Toolkit take just minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming .NET Web Services&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive tutorial that teaches you the skills needed to develop web services hosted on the .NET platform.  Written for experienced programmers, this book takes you beyond the obvious functionality of ASP.NET or Visual Studio .NET to give you a solid foundation in the building blocks of web services, and leads you step-by-step through the process of creating your own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with a close look at the underlying technologies of web services, including the benefits and limitations, &lt;i&gt;Programming .NET Web Services&lt;/i&gt; discusses the unique features of the .NET Framework that make creating web services easier, including the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the namespaces used in .NET programming.  Filled with numerous code examples using the C# language, the book leads you through some of the more challenging issues of web services development, including the use of proxies, marshalling of complex data types, state management, security, performance tuning and cross-platform implementation.  The book also covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating and publishing your first web service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UDDI project, tModels and what they mean for web service publishers
&lt;i&gt;Securing web service applications&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Written for programmers who are familiar with the .NET Framework and interested in building industrial-strength web services, &lt;i&gt;Programming .NET Web Services&lt;/i&gt; is full of practical information and good old-fashioned advice. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive tutorial teaches programmers the skills they need to develop XML web services hosted on the Microsoft .NET platform. &lt;i&gt;Programming .NET Web Services&lt;/i&gt; also shows you how to consume these services on both Microsoft and non-Windows clients, and how to weave them into well-designed and scalable applications. For those interested in building industrial-strength web services, this book is full of practical information and good old-fashioned advice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need to create or use formal descriptions of XML vocabularies, the W3C's XML Schema offers a powerful set of tools for defining acceptable document structures and content.  An alternative to DTDs as the way to describe and validate data in an XML environment, XML Schema enables developers to create precise descriptions with a richer set of datatypes?such as booleans, numbers, currencies, dates and times?that are essential for today?s applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schemas are powerful, but that power comes with substantial complexity. This concise book explains the ins and outs of XML Schema, including design choices, best practices, and limitations. Particularly valuable are discussions of how the type structures fit with existing database and object-oriented program contexts.  With XML Schema, you can define acceptable content models and annotate those models with additional type information, making them more readily bound to programs and objects.  Schemas combine the easy interchange of text-based XML with the more stringent requirements of data exchange, and make it easier to validate documents based on namespaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You?ll find plenty of examples in this book that demonstrate the details necessary for precise vocabulary definitions.  Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Foundations of XML Schema syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Flat, "russian-doll", and other schema approaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Working with simple and complex types in a variety of contexts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The built-in datatypes provided by XML Schema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Using facets to extend datatypes, including regular expression-based patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Using keys and uniqueness rules to limit how and where information may appear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Creating extensible schemas and managing extensibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Documenting schemas and extending XML Schema capabilities through annotations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the explanatory content, &lt;i&gt;XML Schema&lt;/i&gt;provides a complete reference to all parts of both the XML Schema Structures and XML Schema Datatypes specifications, as well as a glossary. Appendices explore the relationships between XML Schema and other tools for describing document structures, including DTDs, RELAX NG, and Schematron, as well as work in progress at the W3C to more tightly integrate XML Schema with existing specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how you intend to use XML Schema - for data structures or document structures, for standalone documents or part of SOAP transactions, for documentation, validation, or data binding ? all the foundations you need are outlined in &lt;i&gt;XML Schema&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The W3C's XML Schema offers a powerful set of tools for defining acceptable XML document structures and content. While schemas are powerful, that power comes with substantial complexity. This book explains XML Schema foundations, a variety of different styles for writing schemas, simple and complex types, datatypes and facets, keys, extensibility, documentation, design choices, best practices, and limitations. Complete with references, a glossary, and examples throughout.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>BGP</title>
    <author>Iljitsch van Beijnum</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing protocol used to exchange routing information across the Internet. It makes it possible for ISPs to connect to each other and for end-users to connect to more than one ISP.  BGP is the only protocol that is designed to deal with a network of the Internet's size, and the only protocol that can deal well with having multiple connections to unrelated routing domains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a guide to all aspects of BGP: the protocol, its configuration and operation in an Internet environment, and how to troubleshooting it. The book also describes how to secure BGP, and how BGP can be used as a tool in combating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Although the examples throughout this book are for Cisco routers, the techniques discussed can be applied to any BGP-capable router.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Requesting an AS number and IP addresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route filtering by remote ISPs and how to avoid this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring the initial BGP setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancing the available incoming or outgoing traffic over the available connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing and troubleshooting BGP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BGP in larger networks: interaction with internal routing protocols, scalability issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BGP in Internet Service Provider networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The book is filled with numerous configuration examples with more complex case studies at the end of the book to strengthen your understanding. &lt;i&gt;BGP&lt;/i&gt; is for anyone interested in creating reliable connectivity to the Internet. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Understanding Linux Network Internals</title>
    <author>Christian Benvenuti</author>

      <subject>COMPUTERS</subject>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've ever wondered how Linux carries out the complicated tasks assigned to it by the IP protocols -- or if you just want to learn about modern networking through real-life examples -- &lt;i&gt;Understanding Linux Network Internals&lt;/i&gt; is for you.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Like the popular O'Reilly book, &lt;i&gt;Understanding the Linux Kernel&lt;/i&gt;, this book clearly explains the underlying concepts and teaches you how to follow the actual C code that implements it. Although some background in the TCP/IP protocols is helpful, you can learn a great deal from this text about the protocols themselves and their uses. And if you already have a base knowledge of C, you can use the book's code walkthroughs to figure out exactly what this sophisticated part of the Linux kernel is doing.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Part of the difficulty in understanding networks -- and implementing them -- is that the tasks are broken up and performed at many different times by different pieces of code. One of the strengths of this book is to integrate the pieces and reveal the relationships between far-flung functions and data structures.  &lt;i&gt;Understanding Linux Network Internals&lt;/i&gt; is both a big-picture discussion and a no-nonsense guide to the details of Linux networking.  Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key problems with networking
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Network interface card (NIC) device drivers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;System initialization
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Layer 2 (link-layer) tasks and implementation
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Layer 3 (IPv4) tasks and implementation
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neighbor infrastructure and protocols (ARP)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bridging
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Routing
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ICMP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Author Christian Benvenuti, an operating system designer specializing in networking, explains much more than how Linux code works.  He shows the purposes of major networking features and the trade-offs involved in choosing one solution over another.  A large number of flowcharts and other diagrams enhance the book's understandability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A no-nonsense guide to Linux networking, &lt;i&gt;Understanding Linux Network Internals&lt;/i&gt; offers a clear view of the underlying concepts and teaches you to follow the C code that implements it.

    <title>VB.NET Core Classes in a  Nutshell</title>
    <author>Budi Kurniawan, Ted Neward</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The .NET platform gives Visual Basic developers access to an entirely new and comprehensive class library that promises to further simplify and speed VB application development. In &lt;i&gt;VB.NET Core Classes in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, VB Programmers will find a concise and thorough reference to the types found in the core namespaces of the .NET Framework Class Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of this book is a classic Nutshell Quick Reference to all the types found in 22 core .NET namespaces. The entry for each type describes its significance, explains how the type is used in .NET applications and lists its members and their signatures in readable VB.NET syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core namespaces documented in this book include types in the following areas:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Essential system and programming services found in the System namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Text handling and regular expression pattern searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Diagnostics, debugging, and performance monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Generalized and specialized collection objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Reflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Extensible Markup Language (XML)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Input/output and serialization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Threading and timers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;COM interop and globalization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An essential companion to &lt;i&gt;VB.NET Language in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, this book completes a two-volume reference that VB.NET programmers will turn to repeatedly in both its print and online versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a special partnership between O'Reilly and Microsoft, now you can integrate the content from this "In a Nutshell" title with the Dynamic Help inside Visual Studio .NET.  Once you install the plug-in using the enclosed CD-ROM, you'll have full access to its 22 namespace overviews and 700-plus type entries. Requires Visual Studio .NET or Visual Basic .NET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;VB.NET Core Classes in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, provides a concise and thorough reference to the types found in the core namespaces of the .NET Framework Class Library. A companion to &lt;i&gt;VB.NET Language in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, this is a reference that VB.NET programmers will turn to repeatedly. Due to a special partnership between O'Reilly and Microsoft, this book also includes a CD that integrates the book's reference into Visual Studio .NET.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are new to Unix, this concise book will tell you  just what you need to get started and no more. Unix was  one of the first operating systems written in C, a  high-level programming language, and its natural  portability and low price made it a popular choice among  universities. Initially, two main dialects of Unix existed:  one produced by AT&amp;amp;T known as System V, and one developed  at UC Berkeley and known as BSD. In recent years, many  other dialects have been created, including the highly  popular Linux operating system and the new Mac OS X  (a derivative of BSD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning the Unix Operating System&lt;/i&gt; is a handy book  for someone just starting with Unix or Linux, and it's an  ideal primer for Mac and PC users of the Internet who need  to know a little about Unix on the systems they visit. The  fifth edition is the most effective introduction to Unix  in print, covering Internet usage for email, file transfers,  web browsing, and many major and minor updates to help the  reader navigate the ever-expanding capabilities of the  operating system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In response to the popularity of Linux,  the book now focuses on the popular bash shell preferred  by most Linux users.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the release of the fourth edition,  the Internet and its many functions has become part of  most computer user's lives. A new chapter explains how  to use ftp, pine for mail, and offers useful knowledge  on how to surf the web.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today everyone is concerned about  security. With this in mind, the author has included  tips throughout the text on security basics,  especially in the Internet and networking sections.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book includes a completely updated quick reference  card to make it easier for the reader to access the key  functions of the command line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a structure for describing and interchanging metadata on the Web--anything from library catalogs and worldwide directories to bioinformatics, Mozilla internal data structures, and knowledge bases for artificial intelligence projects. RDF provides a consistent framework and syntax for describing and querying data, making it possible to share website descriptions more easily. RDF's capabilities, however, have long been shrouded by its reputation for complexity and a difficult family of specifications. &lt;i&gt;Practical RDF&lt;/i&gt; breaks through this reputation with immediate and solvable problems to help you understand, master, and implement RDF solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Practical RDF&lt;/i&gt; explains RDF from the ground up, providing real-world examples and descriptions of how the technology is being used in applications like Mozilla, FOAF, and Chandler, as well as infrastructure you can use to build your own applications. This book cuts to the heart of the W3C's often obscure specifications, giving you tools to apply RDF successfully in your own projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the book focuses on the RDF specifications. After an introduction to RDF, the book covers the RDF specification documents themselves, including RDF Semantics and Concepts and Abstract Model specifications, RDF constructs, and the RDF Schema. The second section focuses on programming language support, and the tools and utilities that allow developers to review, edit, parse, store, and manipulate RDF/XML. Subsequent sections focus on RDF's data roots, programming and framework support, and practical implementation and use of RDF and RDF/XML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know how to apply RDF to information processing, &lt;i&gt;Practical RDF&lt;/i&gt; is for you. Whether your interests lie in large-scale information aggregation and analysis or in smaller-scale projects like weblog syndication, this book will provide you with a solid foundation for working with RDF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important challenges faced by Oracle database  administrators and Oracle developers is the need to tune SQL  statements so that they execute efficiently. Poorly tuned SQL  statements are one of the leading causes of substandard database  performance and poor response time. SQL statements that perform  poorly result in frustration for users, and can even prevent a  company from serving its customers in a timely manner.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In this book, Mark Gurry shares his in-depth knowledge of Oracle's  SQL statement optimizers. Mark's knowledge is the result of many  hard-fought tuning battles during his many years of providing Oracle  tuning services to clients. Mark provides insights into the workings  of the rule-based optimizer that go well beyond what the rules tell  you. Mark also provides solutions to many common problems that occur  with both the rule-based and cost-based optimizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to the specific problem/solution scenarios for the optimizers,  Mark provides a number of handy SQL tuning tips. He discusses the various  optimizer hints, telling you when they can be used to good effect. Finally,  Mark discusses the use of the DBMS_STATS package to manage database statistics,  and the use of outlines to specify execution plans for SQL statements in  third-party applications that you can't otherwise modify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many Java developers, web services appeared to come out of nowhere.  Its advantages are clear: web services are platform-independent (like Java itself), language-agnostic (a clear advantage over Java RMI), can easily be tunneled through firewalls (an obvious benefit to anyone who has dealt with modern enterprise networks), object-oriented (we all know about that), and tends to be loosely coupled (allowing more flexible application development).  But these advantages have been obscured by a cloud of hype and a proliferation of jargon that are difficult to penetrate.  What are SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, and JAXM?  To say nothing of JAXR, tModels, category bags, WSFL, and other friends?  And assuming that you understand what they are, how do you do anything with them?  Do they live up to their promises?  Are they really the future of network computing, or a dead end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Web Services&lt;/i&gt; gives the experienced Java developer a way into the Web Services world.  It helps you to understand what's going on, what the technologies mean and how they relate, and shows Java developers how to put them to use to solve real problems.  You'll learn what's real and what isn't; what the technologies are really supposed to do, and how they do it.  Java Web Services shows you how to use SOAP to perform remote method calls and message passing; how to use WSDL to describe the interface to a web service or understand the interface of someone else's service; and how to use UDDI to advertise (publish) and look up services in each local or global registry.  Java Web Services also discusses security issues, interoperability issues, integration with other Java enterprise technologies like EJB; the work being done on the JAXM and
JAX-RPC packages, and integration with Microsoft's .NET services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web services picture is still taking shape; there are many platforms and APIs to consider, and many conflicting claims from different marketing groups.  And although web services are inherently language-independent, the fit between the fundamental principles on which Java and web services are based means that Java will almost certainly be the predominant language for web services development.  If you're a Java developer and want to climb on the web services bandwagon, or if you only want to "kick the tires" and find out what web services has to offer, you will find this book indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Web Services&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to use SOAP to perform remote method calls and message passing; how to use WSDL to describe the interface to a web service or understand the interface of someone else's service; and how to use UDDI to advertise (publish) and look up services in each local or global registry. &lt;i&gt;Java Web Services&lt;/i&gt; also discusses security issues, interoperability issues, integration with other Java enterprise technologies like EJB; the work being done on the JAXM and JAX-RPC packages, and integration with Microsoft's .NET services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Network Security with OpenSSL</title>
    <author>John Viega, Matt Messier, Pravir Chandra</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most applications these days are at least somewhat network aware, but how do you protect those applications against common network security threats?  Many developers are turning to OpenSSL, an open source version of SSL/TLS, which is the most widely used protocol for secure network communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OpenSSL library is seeing widespread adoption for web sites that require cryptographic functions to protect a broad range of sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and other financial transactions. The library is the only free, full-featured SSL implementation for C and C++,  and it can be used programmatically or from the command line to secure most TCP-based network protocols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Network Security with OpenSSL&lt;/i&gt; enables developers to use this protocol much more effectively. Traditionally, getting something simple done in OpenSSL could easily take weeks.   This concise book gives you the guidance you need to avoid pitfalls, while allowing you to take advantage of the library?s advanced features.   And, instead of bogging you down in the technical details of how SSL works under the hood, this book provides only the information that is necessary to use OpenSSL safely and effectively.  In step-by-step fashion, the book details the challenges in securing network communications, and shows you how to use OpenSSL tools to best meet those challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a system or network administrator, you will benefit from the thorough treatment of the OpenSSL command-line interface, as well as from step-by-step directions for obtaining certificates and setting up your own certification authority.  As a developer, you will further benefit from the in-depth discussions and examples of how to use OpenSSL in your own programs.  Although OpenSSL is written in C, information on how to use OpenSSL with Perl, Python and PHP is also included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenSSL may well answer your need to protect sensitive data. If that?s the case, &lt;i&gt;Network Security with OpenSSL&lt;/i&gt; is the only guide available on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenSSL is a popular and effective open source version of SSL/TLS, the most widely used protocol for secure network communications.  The only guide available on the subject, &lt;i&gt;Network Security with OpenSSL&lt;/i&gt;details the challenges in securing network communications, and shows you how to use OpenSSL tools to best meet those challenges.  Focused on the practical, this book provides only the information that is necessary to use OpenSSL safely and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Access Database Design &amp;amp; Programming&lt;/i&gt; takes you behind the details of the Access interface, focusing on the  general knowledge necessary for Access power users or developers to create effective database applications. When using software products with graphical interfaces, we frequently focus so much on the interface that we forget  about the general concepts that allow us to understand and use the software effectively. In particular, this book  focuses on three areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Database design&lt;/b&gt;. The book provides an enjoyable, informative overview of database design that  carefully shows you how to normalize tables to eliminate redundancy without losing data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Queries&lt;/b&gt;. The book examines multi-table queries (i.e.,various types of joins) and shows how to  implement them indirectly by using the Access interface or directly by using Access SQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Programming&lt;/b&gt;. The book examines the VBA integrated development environment (IDE). It then goes on  to provide an excellent introduction to Data Access Objects (DAO), ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), and ADO Extensions for Data Definition and Security (ADOX). These sections serve as a handy introduction and primer for basic  database operations,such as modifying a table under program control, dynamically adding and deleting a record,  and repositioning a record pointer. The concluding chapter focuses on common programming problems, such as  computing running sums and comparing two sets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Unlike other Access books that take the long, detailed approach to every topic of concern to Access programmers,  &lt;i&gt;Access Database Design &amp;amp;Programming&lt;/i&gt; instead focuses on the core concepts, enabling programmers to develop  solid, effective database applications. This book also serves as a 'second course' in Access that provides a  relatively experienced Access user who is new to programming with the frequently overlooked techniques necessary  to develop successfully in the Microsoft Access environment.
&lt;p&gt;Anyone interested in learning Access in depth, rather than just scraping the surface, will enjoy and benefit  immensely from reading this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;When using GUI-based software, we often focus so much on the interface that we forget about the general concepts required to use the software effectively. &lt;i&gt;Access Database Design &amp;amp; Programming&lt;/i&gt; takes you behind the details of the interface, focusing on the general knowledge necessary for Access power users or developers to create effective database applications. The main sections of this book include: database design,queries, and programming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concise guide offers the basic concepts of IP routing,
free of hype and jargon. It begins with the simplest routing protocol, RIP, and then proceeds, in order of complexity, to IGRP, EIGRP, RIP2, OSPF, and finally to BGP. New concepts are presented one at a time in successive chapters. By the end, you will have mastered not only the fundamentals of all the major routing protocols,
but also the underlying principles on which they are based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic information in &lt;i&gt;IP Routing&lt;/i&gt; is designed to help you begin configuring protocols for Cisco routers. Although author Ravi Malhotra assumes that readers have a basic understanding of TCP/IP and are somewhat familiar with Cisco router configurations, he also assumes that you find some or all of these protocols difficult to work
with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His book presents concepts simply, as nuts and bolts. Malhotra's use of plain language, analogy, and the recurring example of an imaginary network, which grows in complexity as the book progresses, will help you understand fundamental concepts behind each protocol. Once you master
these concepts, you will benefit from the detailed information contained in Cisco manuals and web pages (such as bug lists, new features, design guides, etc). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your skill level, you can either read &lt;i&gt;IP Routing&lt;/i&gt; from cover to cover or use it as a reference for any of the protocols presented. The book describes administrative tools available to all the routing protocols, including those that block the advertisement of routing updates, and those that set up preferences for one routing protocol over another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honed by years of teaching Data Communications at major universities and managing IP networks in production environments, Ravi Malhotra's knowledge of this subject makes IP Routing is the ideal primer to Internet routing protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java Data Objects revolutionizes the way Java developers interact with databases and other datastores.  JDO allows you to store and retrieve objects in a way that's natural to Java programmers.  Instead of working with JDBC or EJB's container-managed persistence, you work directly with your Java objects. You don't have to copy data to and from database tables or issue SELECTs to perform queries: your JDO implementation takes care of persistence behind-the-scenes, and you make queries based on the fields of your Java objects, using normal Java syntax.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The result is software that is truly object-oriented: not code that is partially object-oriented, with a large database-shaped lump on the back end.  JDO lets you save plain, ordinary Java objects, and does not force you to use different data models and types for dealing with storage.  As a result, your code becomes easier to maintain, easier to re-use, and easier to test.  And you're not tied to a specific database vendor: your JDO code is entirely database-independent.  You don't even need to know whether the datastore is a relational database, an object database, or just a set of files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book, written by the JDO Specification Lead and one of the key contributors to the JDO Specification, is the definitive work on the JDO API.  It gives you a thorough introduction to JDO, starting with a simple application that demonstrates many of JDO's capabilities.  It shows you how to make classes persistent, how JDO maps persistent classes to the database, how to configure JDO at runtime, how to perform transactions, and how to make queries.  More advanced chapters cover optional features such as nontransactional access and optimistic transactions.  The book concludes by discussing the use of JDO in web applications and J2EE environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whether you only want to read up on an interesting new technology, or are seriously considering an alternative to JDBC or EJB CMP, you'll find that this book is essential.  It provides by far the most authoritative and complete coverage available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More Java developers today want to work with XML, the technology that enables data to be transported intact over the Internet, but they don't have time to become XML experts. If this describes you, then you'll appreciate data binding, the new way of converting XML documents into Java objects, so those documents can be worked on and manipulated like any other Java object, then converted back to XML
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This new title provides an in-depth technical look at XML Data Binding.  The book offers complete documentation of all features in both the Sun Microsystems JAXB API and popular open source alternative implementations (Enhydra Zeus, Exolabs Castor and Quick). It also gets into significant detail about when data binding is appropriate to use, and provides numerous practical examples of using data binding in applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As Author Brett McLaughlin says "Too many books are written about technologies by people who barely understand them.  I've already written two data binding implementations (Zeus, and a previous one for IBM DeveloperWorks.)  I've actually used data binding for longer than the official specification has been in existence, and I've really been able to dig into what it takes to code an effective data biding implementation, as well as use one correctly.  This book is part user guide, part under-the-hood manual, and part use-case.  It's a powerful combination, and one I think people need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;System Performance Tuning&lt;/i&gt; answers one of the most fundamental questions you can ask about your computer: How can I get it to do more work without buying more hardware? In the current economic downturn, performance tuning takes on a new importance. It allows system administrators to make the best use of existing systems and minimize the purchase of new equipment. Well-tuned systems save money and time that would otherwise be wasted dealing with slowdowns and errors. Performance tuning always involves compromises; unless system administrators know what the compromises are, they can't make intelligent decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuning is an essential skill for system administrators who face the problem of adapting the speed of a computer system to the speed requirements imposed by the real world. It requires a detailed understanding of the inner workings of the computer and its architecture. System Performance Tuning covers two distinct areas: performance tuning, or the art of increasing performance for a specific application, and capacity planning, or deciding what hardware best fulfills a given role. Underpinning both subjects is the science of computer architecture. This book focuses on the operating system, the underlying hardware, and their interactions. Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Real and perceived performance problems, introducing capacity planning and performance monitoring (highlighting their strengths and weaknesses). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;An integrated description of all the major tools at a system administrator's disposal for tracking down system performance problems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Background on modern memory handling techniques, including the memory-caching filesystem implementations in Solaris and AIX. Updated sections on memory conservation and computing memory requirements. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;In depth discussion of disk interfaces, bandwidth capacity considerations, and RAID systems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Comprehensive discussion of NFS and greatly expanded discussion of networking. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Workload management and code tuning. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Special topics such as tuning Web servers for various types of content delivery and developments in cross-machine parallel computing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For system administrators who want a hands-on introduction to system performance, this is the book to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Free as in Freedom&lt;/i&gt; interweaves biographical snapshots of GNU project founder Richard Stallman with the political, social and economic history of the free software movement. It examines Stallman's unique personality and how that personality has been at turns a driving force and a drawback in terms of the movement's overall success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Free as in Freedom&lt;/i&gt; examines one man's 20-year attempt to codify and communicate the ethics of 1970s era "hacking" culture in such a way that later generations might easily share and build upon the knowledge of their computing forebears. The book documents Stallman's personal evolution from teenage misfit to prescient adult hacker to political leader and examines how that evolution has shaped the free software movement. Like Alan Greenspan in the financial sector, Richard Stallman has assumed the role of tribal elder within the hacking community, a community that bills itself as anarchic and averse to central leadership or authority. How did this paradox come about? &lt;i&gt;Free as in Freedom&lt;/i&gt; provides an answer. It also looks at how the latest twists and turns in the software marketplace have diminished Stallman's leadership role in some areas while augmenting it in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;i&gt;Free as in Freedom&lt;/i&gt; examines both Stallman and the free software movement from historical viewpoint. Will future generations see Stallman as a genius or crackpot? The answer to that question depends partly on which side of the free software debate the reader currently stands and partly upon the reader's own outlook for the future. 100 years from now, when terms such as "computer," "operating system" and perhaps even "software" itself seem hopelessly quaint, will Richard Stallman's particular vision of freedom still resonate, or will it have taken its place alongside other utopian concepts on the 'ash-heap of history?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Free as in Freedom&lt;/i&gt; examines one man's 20-year attempt to codify and communicate the ethics of 1970s era "hacking" culture in such a way that later generations might easily share and build upon the knowledge of their computing forebears. The book documents Stallman's personal evolution from teenage misfit to prescient adult hacker to political leader and examines how that evolution has shaped the free software movement. Like Alan Greenspan in the financial sector, Richard Stallman has assumed the role of tribal elder within the hacking community, a community that bills itself as anarchic and averse to central leadership or authority. How did this paradox come about? &lt;i&gt;Free as in Freedom&lt;/i&gt; provides an answer. It also looks at how the latest twists and turns in the software marketplace have diminished Stallman's leadership role in some areas while augmenting it in others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;i&gt;Free as in Freedom&lt;/i&gt; examines both Stallman and the free software movement from historical viewpoint. Will future generations see Stallman as a genius or crackpot? The answer to that question depends partly on which side of the free software debate the reader currently stands and partly upon the reader's own outlook for the future. 100 years from now, when terms such as "computer," "operating system" and perhaps even "software" itself seem hopelessly quaint, will Richard Stallman's particular vision of freedom still resonate, or will it have taken its place alongside other utopian concepts on the 'ash-heap of history?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many serious Java programmers, especially enterprise Java programmers, consider the new I/O API--called NIO for New Input/Output--the most important feature in the 1.4 version of the Java 2 Standard Edition. The NIO package includes many things that have been missing from previous editions of Java that are critical to writing high-performance, large-scale applications: improvements in the areas of buffer management, scalable network and file I/O, character-set support, and regular expression matching.  Most of all, it boosts performance and speed dramatically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java NIO&lt;/i&gt; explores the new I/O capabilities of version 1.4 in detail and shows you how to put these features to work to greatly improve the efficiency of the Java code you write.  This compact volume examines the typical challenges that Java programmers face with I/O and shows you how to take advantage of the capabilities of the new I/O features.  You?ll learn how to put these tools to work using examples of common, real-world I/O problems and see how the new features have a direct impact on responsiveness, scalability, and reliability.  The book includes:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rundown of the new features in NIO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic and advanced I/O Concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Binary I/O and the new buffer classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory mapped files and file locking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Character I/O: encoding, decoding and transforming character data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular Expressions and the new java.util.regex package&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muliplexing with java.nio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Because the NIO APIs supplement the I/O features of version 1.3, rather than replace them, you'll also learn when to use new APIs and when the older 1.3 I/O APIs are better suited to your particular application.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java NIO&lt;/i&gt; is for any Java programmer who is interested in learning how to boost I/O performance, but if you're developing applications where performance is critical, such as game computing or large-scale enterprise applications, you'll want to give this book a permanent spot on your bookshelf.  With the NIO APIs, Java no longer takes a backseat to any language when it comes to performance.  &lt;i&gt;Java NIO&lt;/i&gt; will help you realize the benefits of these exciting new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>802.11 Security</title>
    <author>Bruce Potter, Bob Fleck</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mention wireless networks, and the question of security will soon follow. It's not surprising that in spite of compelling business arguments for going wireless, many companies are holding back because of security concerns.  But, while it's true that wireless networks create security issues that don't exist in wired networks, the issues are not insurmountable. &lt;i&gt;802.11 Security&lt;/i&gt; shows how you can plan for and successfully contend with security obstacles in your wireless deployment.  This authoritative book not only explains the security issues, but shows you how to design and build a your own secure wireless network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;802.11 Security&lt;/i&gt; covers the entire process of building secure 802.11-based wireless networks, in particular, the 802.11b ("Wi-Fi") specification.  The authors provide detailed coverage of security issues unique to wireless networking, such as Wireless Access Points (WAP), bandwidth stealing, and the problematic Wired Equivalent Privacy component of 802.11.  You'll learn how to configure a wireless client and to set up a WAP using either Linux or Free BSD.  You'll also find thorough information on controlling network access and encrypting client traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with an introduction to 802.11b in general, the book gives you a broad basis in theory and practice of wireless security, dispelling some of the myths along the way.  In doing so, they provide you with the technical grounding required to think about how the rest of the book applies to your specific needs and situations. Next, the book details the technical setup instructions needed for both the Linux and FreeBSD operating systems.
Some of the topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Station Security for Linux, FreeBSD, Open BSD, Mac OS X and Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting Up Access Point Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gateway Security, including building Gateways, firewall Rules, Auditing, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication and Encryption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreeBSD IPsec client and gateway configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux IPsec client and gateway configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.1x authentication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;802.11 Security&lt;/i&gt; is a book whose time has come. If you are a network, security, or systems engineer, or anyone interested in deploying 802.11b-based systems, you'll want this book beside you every step of the way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>XPath and XPointer</title>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to specific information inside an XML document is a little like finding a needle in a haystack: how do you differentiate the information you need from everything else?  XPath and XPointer are two closely related languages that play a key role in XML processing by allowing developers to find these needles and manipulate embedded information.  XPath describes a route for finding specific items by defining a path through the hierarchy of an XML document, abstracting only the information that's relevant for identifying the data.  XPointer extends XPath to identify more complex parts of documents.  The two technologies are critical for developers seeking needles in haystacks in various types of processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;XPath and XPointer&lt;/i&gt; fills an essential need for XML developers by focusing directly on a critical topic that has been covered only briefly.  Written by John Simpson, an author with considerable XML experience, the book offers practical knowledge of the two languages that underpin XML, XSLT and XLink. &lt;i&gt;XPath and XPointer&lt;/i&gt; cuts through basic theory and provides real-world examples that you can use right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written for XML and XSLT developers and anyone else who needs to address information in XML documents, the book assumes a working knowledge of XML and XSLT.  It begins with an introduction to XPath basics.  You'll learn about location steps and paths, XPath functions and numeric operators.  Once you've covered XPath in depth, you'll move on to XPointer--its background, syntax, and forms of addressing.  By the time you've finished the book, you'll know how to construct a full XPointer (one that uses an XPath location path to address document content) and completely understand both the XPath and XPointer features it uses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;XPath and XPointer&lt;/i&gt; contains material on the forthcoming XPath 2.0 spec and EXSLT extensions, as well as versions 1.0 of both XPath and XPointer.  A succinct but thorough hands-on guide, no other book on the market provides comprehensive information on these two key XML technologies in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>C++ In a Nutshell</title>
    <author>Ray Lischner</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To-the-point, authoritative, no-nonsense solutions have always been a trademark of O'Reilly books. The In a Nutshell books have earned a solid reputation in the field as the well-thumbed references that sit beside the knowledgeable developer's keyboard. &lt;i&gt;C++ in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; lives up to the In a Nutshell promise. &lt;i&gt;C++ in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is a lean, focused reference that offers practical examples for the most important, most often used, aspects of C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C++ in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; packs an enormous amount of information on C++ (and the many libraries used with it) in an indispensable quick reference for those who live in a deadline-driven world and need the facts but not the frills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book's language reference is organized first by topic, followed by an alphabetical reference to the language's keywords, complete with syntax summaries and pointers to the topic references. The library reference is organized by header file, and each library chapter and class declaration presents the classes and types in alphabetical order, for easy lookup. Cross-references link related methods, classes, and other key features. This is an ideal resource for students as well as professional programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're programming, you need answers to questions about language syntax or parameters required by library routines quickly. What, for example, is the C++ syntax to define an alias for a namespace? Just how do you create and use an iterator to work with the contents of a standard library container? &lt;i&gt;C++ in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is a concise desktop reference that answers these questions, putting the full power of this flexible, adaptable (but somewhat difficult to master) language at every C++ programmer's fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequence similarity is a powerful tool for discovering biological function. Just as the ancient Greeks used comparative anatomy to understand the human body and linguists used the Rosetta stone to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs, today we can use comparative sequence analysis to understand genomes. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), is a sophisticated software package for rapid searching of nucleotide and protein databases. It is one of the most important software packages used in sequence analysis and bioinformatics. Most users of BLAST, however, seldom move beyond the program's default parameters, and never take advantage of its full power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;BLAST&lt;/i&gt; is the only book completely devoted to this popular suite of tools. It offers biologists, computational biology students, and bioinformatics professionals a clear understanding of BLAST as well as the science it supports.  This book shows you how to move beyond the default parameters, get specific answers using BLAST, and how to interpret your results. The book also contains tutorial and reference sections covering NCBI-BLAST and WU-BLAST, background material to help you understand the statistics behind BLAST, Perl scripts to help you prepare your data and analyze your results, and a wealth of tips and tricks for configuring BLAST to meet your own research needs. Some of the topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;BLAST basics and the NCBI web interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to select appropriate search parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BLAST programs:  BLASTN, BLASTP, BLASTX, TBLASTN, TBLASTX, PHI-BLAST, and PSI BLAST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed BLAST references, including NCBI-BLAST and WU-BLAST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding biological sequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequence similarity, homology, scoring matrices, scores, and evolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequence Alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculating BLAST statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industrial-strength BLAST, including developing applications with Perl and BLAST&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;BLAST&lt;/i&gt; is the only comprehensive reference with detailed, accurate information on optimizing BLAST searches for high-throughput sequence analysis. This is a book that any biologist should own.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning Cocoa with Objective-C&lt;/i&gt; is the "must-have" book for people who want to develop applications for Mac OS X, and is the only book approved and reviewed by Apple engineers. Based on the Jaguar release of Mac OS X 10.2, this edition of &lt;i&gt;Learning Cocoa&lt;/i&gt; includes examples that use the Address Book and Universal Access APIs. Also included is a handy quick reference card, charting Cocoa's Foundation and AppKit frameworks, along with an Appendix that includes a listing of resources essential to any Cocoa developer--beginning or advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Completely revised and updated, this 2nd edition begins with some simple examples to familiarize you with the basic elements of Cocoa programming as well Apple's Developer Tools, including Project Builder and Interface Builder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After introducing you to Project Builder and Interface Builder, it brings you quickly up to speed on the concepts of object-oriented programming with Objective-C, the language of choice for building Cocoa applications. From there, each chapter presents a different sample program for you to build, with easy to follow, step-by-step instructions to teach you the fundamentals of Cocoa programming. The techniques you will learn in each chapter lay the foundation for more advanced techniques and concepts presented in later chapters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll learn how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effectively use Apple's suite of Developer Tools, including Project Builder and Interface Builder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build single- and multiple-window document-based applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate text data using Cocoa's text handling capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw with Cocoa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add scripting functionality to your applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Localize your application for multiple language support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Polish off your application by adding an icon for use in the Dock, provide Help, and package your program for distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Each chapter ends with a series of Examples, challenging you to test your newly-learned skills by tweaking the application you've just built, or to go back to an earlier example and add to it some new functionality. Solutions are provided in the Appendix, but you're encouraged to learn by trying.
&lt;p&gt;Extensive programming experience is not required to complete the examples in the book, though experience with the C programming language will be helpful. If you are familiar with an object-oriented programming language such as Java or Smalltalk, you will rapidly come up to speed with the Objective-C language. Otherwise, basic object-oriented and language concepts are covered where needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, programming hasn't been considered a critical skill for biologists. But now, with access to vast amounts of biological data contained in public databases, programming skills are increasingly in strong demand in biology research and development. Perl, with its highly developed capacities in string handling, text processing, networking, and rapid prototyping, has emerged as the programming language of choice for biological data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics&lt;/i&gt; covers the core Perl language and many of its module extensions, presenting them in the context of biological data and problems of pressing interest to the biological community.  This book, along with &lt;i&gt;Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics&lt;/i&gt;, forms a basic course in Perl programming.  This second volume finishes the basic Perl tutorial material (references, complex data structures, object-oriented programming, use of modules--all presented in a biological context) and presents some advanced topics of considerable interest in bioinformatics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The range of topics covered in &lt;i&gt;Mastering Perl for Bioinformatics&lt;/i&gt; prepares the reader for enduring and emerging developments in critical areas of bioinformatics programming such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gene finding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;String alignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods of data storage and retrieval (SML and databases)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modeling of networks (graphs and Petri nets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics (Tk)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallelization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interfacing with other programming languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistics (PDL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protein structure determination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biological models of computation (DNA Computers)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Biologists and computer scientists who have conquered the basics of Perl and are ready to move even further in their mastery of this versatile language will appreciate the author's well-balanced approach to applying Perl's analytical abilities to the field of bioinformatics. Full of practical examples and real-world biological problem solving, this book is a must for any reader wanting to move beyond beginner level Perl in bioinformatics.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first five years of existence, The Perl Journal ran 247 articles by over 120 authors.  Every serious Perl programmer subscribed to it, and every notable Perl guru jumped at the opportunity to write for it.  TPJ explained critical topics such as regular expressions, databases, and object-oriented programming, and demonstrated Perl's utility for fields as diverse as astronomy, biology, economics, AI, and games.  The magazine gave birth to both the Obfuscated Perl Contest and the Perl Poetry contest, and remains a proud and timeless achievement of Perl during one of its most exciting periods of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Computer Science and Perl Programming&lt;/i&gt; is the first volume of The Best of the Perl Journal, compiled and re-edited by the original editor and publisher of The Perl Journal, Jon Orwant. In this series, we've taken the very best (and still relevant) articles published in TPJ over its 5 years of publication and immortalized them into three volumes. This volume has 70 articles devoted to hard-core computer science, advanced programming techniques, and the underlying mechanics of Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a sample of what you'll find inside:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jeffrey Friedl on Understanding Regexes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark Jason Dominus on optimizing your Perl programs with Memoization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damian Conway on Parsing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim Meadowcroft on integrating Perl with Microsoft Office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larry Wall on the culture of Perl&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Written by 41 of the most prominent and prolific members of the closely-knit Perl community, this anthology does what no other book can, giving unique insight into the real-life applications and powerful techniques made possible by Perl.
&lt;p&gt;Other books tell you how to use Perl, but this book goes far beyond that: it shows you not only how to use Perl, but what you could use Perl &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;. This is more than just The Best of the Perl Journal -- in many ways, this is the best of Perl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The first of three volumes from the archives of The Perl Journal that O'Reilly has exclusive rights to distribute, this book is a compilation of the best from TPJ: 71 articles providing a comprehensive tour of how experts implement computer science concepts in the real world, with code walkthroughs, case studies, and explanations of difficult techniques that can't be found in any other book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Every serious Perl programmer subscribed to it, and every notable Perl guru jumped at the opportunity to write for it. TPJ explained critical Perl topics and demonstrated Perl's utility for fields as diverse as astronomy, biology, economics, AI, and games. Back issues were hoarded, or swapped like trading cards.  No longer in print format, &lt;i&gt;The Perl Journal&lt;/i&gt; remains a proud and timeless achievement of Perl during one of its most exciting periods of development.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Web, Graphics &amp;amp; Perl/Tk&lt;/i&gt; is the second volume of &lt;i&gt;The Best of the Perl Journal&lt;/i&gt;, compiled and re-edited by the original editor and publisher of &lt;i&gt;The Perl Journal&lt;/i&gt;, Jon Orwant. In this series, we've taken the very best (and still relevant) articles published in TPJ over its five years of publication and immortalized them into three volumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The forty articles included in this volume are simply some of the best Perl articles ever written on the subjects of graphics, the Web, and Perl/Tk, by some of the best Perl authors and coders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Much of Perl's success is due to its capabilities for developing web sites; the Web section covers popular topics such as CGI programs, mod_perl, spidering, HTML parsing, security, and content management. The Graphics section is a grab bag of techniques, ranging from simple graph generation to ray tracing and real-time video digitizing. The Perl/Tk section shows you how to use the popular Perl/Tk toolkit for developing graphical applications that work on both Unix/Linux and Windows without a single change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Written by twenty-three of the most prominent and prolific members of the closely-knit Perl community, including Lincoln Stein, Mark-Jason Dominus, Alligator Descartes, and Dan Brian, this anthology does what no other book can, giving unique insight into the real-life applications and powerful techniques made possible by Perl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Perl Journal&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;TPJ&lt;/i&gt;) did something most print journals aspire to, but few succeed.  Within a remarkable short time, &lt;i&gt;TPJ&lt;/i&gt; acquired a cult-following and became the voice of the Perl community. Every serious Perl programmer subscribed to it, and every notable Perl guru jumped at the opportunity to write for it. Back issues were swapped like trading cards.  No longer in print format, &lt;i&gt;TPJ&lt;/i&gt; remains the quintessential spirit of Perl--a publication for and by Perl programmers who see fun and beauty in an admittedly quirky little language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Games, Diversions, and Perl Culture&lt;/i&gt; is the third volume of &lt;i&gt;The Best of the Perl Journal&lt;/i&gt;, compiled and re-edited by the original editor and publisher of &lt;i&gt;The Perl Journal&lt;/i&gt;, Jon Orwant. In this series, we've taken the very best (and still relevant) articles published in &lt;i&gt;TPJ&lt;/i&gt; over its 5 years of publication and immortalized them into three volumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 47 articles included in this volume are simply some of the best Perl articles ever written on the subjects of games, diversions, and the unique culture of this close-knit community, by some of the best Perl authors and coders. &lt;i&gt;Games, Diversions &amp;amp; Perl Culture&lt;/i&gt; focuses on entertaining topics that make Perl users such fanatics about the language. You'll find all of the playful features &lt;i&gt;TPJ&lt;/i&gt; offered over the years, including the Obfuscated Perl Contests, Perl Quiz Shows, humor articles, and renowned one-line recipes. The book also contains a panoply of quirky applications of Perl, including genetic algorithms, home automation, music programming, and an entire section on natural language processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This anthology is an unmatched compendium of Perl lore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put a hacker in a room with a Furby for a weekend and you'll hear a conversation that's fairly one-sided in its originality. Toss in an 802.11b network card, a soldering iron, wire cutters, a logic probe, and a few other carefully selected tools and materials and you'll have potential.  Add a copy of &lt;i&gt;Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks&lt;/i&gt; and by the end of the weekend that Furby will be saying things you never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From building an Internet toaster to creating a cubicle intrusion detection system, &lt;i&gt;Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks&lt;/i&gt; offers an array of inventive, customized electronics projects for the geek who can't help looking at a gadget and wondering how it might be "upgraded."  Beginning with basic hacks, tools, and techniques for those who may not have a background in electronics, the book covers the tools of the hardware hacking trade and basic soldering techniques, then moves into more advanced hacking projects. Clear  step-by-step instructions allow even those with no formal electronics- or hardware-engineering skills to hack real hardware in very clever ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacks in the book are rated on a scale of difficulty, cost, and duration. Projects range from those that are truly useful to some things you may have never thought to do, but which are really cool, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building your own arcade game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making radio-controlled cars play laser tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building an automobile periscope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hacking an 802.11b antenna&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a building size display&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Perhaps you're an electronics hobbyist who likes to learn by doing. Maybe you hack software and want to see how the other half lives. Or, maybe you've never hacked at all, but you'd like to get started quickly with some projects that do something interesting from the start. If you're any of these, then &lt;i&gt;Hardware Hacking Projects for Geeks&lt;/i&gt; will indulge your inner mad scientist. Using the projects in this book as a jumping point for other new and clever hacks, it won't be long before you're looking around, asking, "I wonder what I can improve next?" &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>C# &amp; VB.NET Conversion Pocket Reference</title>
    <author>Jose Mojica</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though most programmers use two or more languages, they usually have a mastery of one.  Although Microsoft has advertised that the .NET runtime is language agnostic and that C# and Visual Basic .NET are so close that switching between the two is really quite easy, that?s only true up to a point.  Some of the differences are obvious, but others are very subtle. &lt;i&gt;C# &amp;amp; VB.NET Conversion Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; helps you easily make the switch from one language to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differences occur in three main areas: syntax, object-oriented principles, and the Visual Studio .NET IDE. Syntax concerns the statements and language elements. Object oriented differences are less obvious, and concern differences in implementation and feature sets between the two languages. IDE differences include things like compiler settings or attributes. There is also a fourth area of difference: language features that are present in one language but have no equivalent in the other. These unique language features are also covered in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C# &amp;amp; VB.NET Conversion Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is a perfect companion for documents and books that don?t have examples using your mastered language. Author Jose Mojica expects that you know one of the two languages, but does not make an
assumption about which one. He presents the information in a
language-neutral point of view so that programmers from either background can read a section and feel that it is targeted to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Programming .NET Windows Applications</title>
    <author>Jesse Liberty, Dan Hurwitz</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who develop standalone Windows applications for PCs and other devices, Microsoft's .NET Windows Forms provide a much better way to get it done. This new technology gives you more power and flexibility for a fraction of the effort compared to classic Win32 development, with a streamlined programming model that deals automatically with many tedious details that once plagued developers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most things .NET, the only hitch is the learning curve. But that's where acclaimed author Jesse Liberty makes the difference with &lt;i&gt;Programming .NET Windows Applications&lt;/i&gt;. With this tutorial, you will explore all aspects of using .NET Windows Forms class libraries and the associated programming tools in Visual Studio .NET, enabling you to build applications for the Windows 9x, Windows 2000 and Windows XP desktop platforms. Step-by-step, you'll learn ways to design applications that either function alone on a PC, or work in combination with your web-based application server to take advantage of the richer interface and higher level of security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also explains how your new Windows applications can sidestep problems that used to arise from the use of DLLs (known collectively as "DLL hell"), and how .NET Windows Forms can be used as an alternative to ASP.NET and browser-based approaches for building web application clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Liberty definitely knows his stuff when it comes to the .NET platform. As the author of O'Reilly's &lt;i&gt;Programming C#&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Learning Visual Basic .NET&lt;/i&gt;, he's well-known for his clear and concise style that prompted one reviewer to say, "It's as if he knows exactly what questions I'm going to ask ahead of time." Jesse also co-authored &lt;i&gt;Programming ASP.NET&lt;/i&gt; with contract programmer Dan Hurwitz, and now the two have teamed up again to bring you this comprehensive tutorial--without a doubt, the best source available for learning how to program with .NET Windows Forms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subject of security never strays far from the minds of IT workers, for good reason. If there is a network with even just one connection to another network, it needs to be secured. &lt;i&gt;RADIUS&lt;/i&gt;, or Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service, is a widely deployed protocol that enables companies to authenticate, authorize and account for remote users who want access to a system or service from a central network server.  Originally developed for dial-up remote access, RADIUS is now used by virtual private network (VPN) servers, wireless access points, authenticating Ethernet switches, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) access, and other network access types.  Extensible, easy to implement, supported, and actively developed, RADIUS is currently the de facto standard for remote authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;RADIUS&lt;/i&gt; provides a complete, detailed guide to the underpinnings of the RADIUS protocol, with particular emphasis on the utility of user accounting.  Author Jonathan Hassell draws from his extensive experience in Internet service provider operations to bring practical suggestions and advice for implementing RADIUS.  He also provides instructions for using an open-source variation called FreeRADIUS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"RADIUS is an extensible protocol that enjoys the support of a wide range of vendors," says Jonathan Hassell. "Coupled with the amazing efforts of the open source development community to extend RADIUS's capabilities to other applications-Web, calling card security, physical device security, such as RSA's SecureID-RADIUS is possibly the best protocol with which to ensure only the people that need access to a resource indeed gain that access."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This unique book covers RADIUS completely, from the history and theory of the architecture around which it was designed, to how the protocol and its ancillaries function on a day-to-day basis, to implementing RADIUS-based security in a variety of corporate and service provider environments. If you are an ISP owner or administrator, corporate IT professional responsible for maintaining mobile user connectivity, or a web presence provider responsible for providing multiple communications resources, you'll want this book to help you master this widely implemented but little understood protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;i&gt;Practical Unix Security&lt;/i&gt; was first published more than a decade ago, it became an instant classic. Crammed with information about host security, it saved many a Unix system administrator from disaster. The second edition added much-needed Internet security coverage and doubled the size of the original volume. The third edition is a comprehensive update of this very popular book - a companion for the Unix/Linux system administrator who needs to secure his or her organization's system, networks, and web presence in an increasingly hostile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the four most popular Unix variants today--Solaris, Mac OS X, Linux, and FreeBSD--this book contains new information on PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules), LDAP, SMB/Samba, anti-theft technologies, embedded systems, wireless and laptop issues, forensics, intrusion detection, chroot jails, telephone scanners and firewalls, virtual and cryptographic filesystems, WebNFS, kernel security levels, outsourcing, legal issues, new Internet protocols and cryptographic algorithms, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Practical Unix &amp;amp; Internet Security&lt;/i&gt; consists of six parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computer security basics: introduction to security problems and solutions, Unix history and lineage, and the importance of security policies as a basic element of system security.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security building blocks: fundamentals of Unix passwords, users, groups, the Unix filesystem, cryptography, physical security, and personnel security.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Network security: a detailed look at modem and dialup security, TCP/IP, securing individual network services, Sun's RPC, various host and network authentication systems (e.g., NIS, NIS+, and Kerberos), NFS and other filesystems, and the importance of secure programming.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Secure operations: keeping up to date in today's changing security world, backups, defending against attacks, performing integrity management, and auditing.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Handling security incidents: discovering a break-in, dealing with programmed threats and denial of service attacks, and legal aspects of computer security.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Appendixes: a comprehensive security checklist and a detailed bibliography of paper and electronic references for further reading and research.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with 1000 pages of helpful text, scripts, checklists, tips, and warnings, this third edition remains the definitive reference for Unix administrators and anyone who cares about protecting their systems and data from today's threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XSLT is a powerful language for transforming XML documents into something else. That something else can be an HTML document, another XML document, a Portable Document Format (PDF) file, a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file, a Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) file, Java code, or a number of other things.  You write an XSLT stylesheet to define the rules for transforming an XML document, and the XSLT processor does the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As useful as XSLT is, its peculiar characteristics make it a difficult language in which to get started. In fact, newcomers are often a little dazed on first contact. &lt;i&gt;Learning XSLT&lt;/i&gt; offers a hands-on introduction to help them get up to speed with XSLT quickly. The book will help web developers and designers understand this powerful but often mystifying template-driven and functional-styled language, getting them over the many differences between XSLT and the more conventional programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning XSLT&lt;/i&gt; moves smoothly from the simple to complex, illustrating all aspects of XSLT 1.0 through step-by-step examples that you'll practice as you work through the book. Thorough in its coverage of the language, the book makes few assumptions about what you may already know. You'll learn about XSLT's template-based syntax, how XSLT templates work with each other, and gain an understanding of XSLT variables. &lt;i&gt;Learning XSLT&lt;/i&gt; also explains how the XML Path Language (XPath) is used by XSLT and provides a glimpse of what the future holds for XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to transform one XML vocabulary to another is fundamental to exploiting the power of XML. &lt;i&gt;Learning XSLT&lt;/i&gt; is a carefully paced, example-rich introduction to XSLT that will have you understanding and using XSLT on your own in no time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Office X for Macintosh:  The Missing Manual</title>
    <author>Nan Barber, Tonya Engst, David Reynolds</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mac OS X, Apple's super-advanced, Unix-based operating system, offers every desirable system-software feature known to humans. But without a compatible software library, the Mac of the future was doomed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office X for Macintosh is exactly the software suite most Mac fans were waiting for. Its four programs--Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage--have been completely overhauled to take advantage of the stunning looks and rock-like stability of Mac OS X. But this magnificent package comes without a single page of printed instructions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Pogue Press/O'Reilly is once again there to rescue the befuddled and overwhelmed--with &lt;i&gt;Office X for Macintosh: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;. It tackles each of the primary Office applications with depth, humor, and clarity, and provides relief for the hapless Mac user who'd rather read professionally written printed instructions than hunt through a maze of dryly written help screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Office X for Macintosh: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is coauthored by a dream team of Macintosh experts: Tonya Engst, coeditor of the popular TidBITS Macintosh newsletter; David Reynolds, former executive editor of MacAddict magazine (now working at Apple); and Nan Barber, Macworld contributor and coauthor of &lt;i&gt;Office 2001 for Macintosh: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;, on which this book is based. Once again, the authors are joined by series founder David Pogue, who has closely edited the book to ensure excellence of depth, accuracy, and prose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Oracle in a Nutshell</title>
    <author>Rick Greenwald, David C. Kreines</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduced a quarter-century ago, the Oracle database remains the leading enterprise relational database management system (RDBMS) in the world. Oracle is a complex system, offering a myriad of products, languages, and tools. Frequent updates, releases, and editions complicate the ability of Oracle users to keep up with the huge amounts of frequently changing information about the database and its capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of &lt;i&gt;Oracle in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is to pull together the most essential information on Oracle architecture, syntax, and user interfaces. The content and format of this book, an admirable addition to O'Reilly's respected In-a-Nutshell line, combine to boil down vital Oracle commands, language constructs, parameters, and file formats in a succinct and highly accessible desktop reference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oracle in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; covers the information that database administrators PL/SQL and Java developers, and system, network, and security administrators need as they manage Oracle databases and write code for these databases. It includes:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oracle Foundations--Overview of the Oracle architecture (memory structures and fundamental concepts), Oracle's various editions and packaging options, summary of the initialization file parameters and data dictionary views, and fundamentals of Oracle's concurrency scheme, security mechanisms (privileges, profiles, roles), and networking files (TNSNAMES.ORA, SQLNET.ORA, LISTENER.ORA, DAP.ORA, NAMES.ORA, CMAN.ORA) and options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracle Languages--Syntax summary for SQL language statements, SQL function calls PL/SQL language statements and characteristics, PL/SQL built-in package headers, and Java (JDBC and SQLJ) interfaces to the Oracle database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracle Tools--Commands provided with SQL&lt;em&gt;Plus, SQL&lt;/em&gt;Loader, Import and Export, Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) and other backup/recovery methods, Oracle Enterprise Manager, and various performance  tuning tools (Explain Plan, TKPROF, AUTOTRACE, UTLBSTAT, UTLESTAT, Statspack).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appendixes--Summary of Oracle datatypes, operators, expressions, conditions, numeric and date formats, and resources for additional reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>.NET Windows Forms in a Nutshell</title>
    <author>Ian Griffiths, Matthew Adams</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;.NET Windows Forms are a powerful technology for building a large class of applications for the Windows .NET platform. They offer nearly the same power and flexibility of classic Win32 development, but for a fraction of the effort. The programming model is lean and streamlined, and many of the tedious details that developers used to have to spend time on are now dealt with automatically by the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;.NET Windows Forms in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; offers an accelerated introduction to this next-generation of rich user interface development.  The book provides an all-inclusive guide for experienced programmers using the .NET Windows Forms platform to develop Windows applications, along with a compact but remarkably complete reference to the .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) Windows Forms namespaces and types. The authors present solid coverage of the fundamental building blocks, such as Controls, Forms, Menus, and GDI+, and enough detail to help you build your own fully featured reusable visual components so you can write visual component libraries as well as standalone applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;.NET Windows Forms in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; aims to provide not just the practical information and advice required to get programs working, but also to communicate the rationale behind the various parts of Windows Forms' design.  The authors show how the thinking behind the framework enhances your productivity substantially.  The new framework allows you to guess correctly what "the Right Way" to do things is a majority of the time, even if you've never tried what you're doing before. No more digging around in documentation for days to try to find the bit of information you need to use one particular feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is involved in user interface development will appreciate the ease of creation and expanded capabilities provided by .NET Windows Forms, as well as the in-depth focus and straight-forward approach this book brings. Included on CD is an add-in that will integrate the book's reference directly into the help files of Visual Studio .NET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Essential System Administration&lt;/i&gt;,3rd Edition is the definitive guide for Unix system administration, covering all the fundamental and essential tasks required to run such divergent Unix systems as AIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Tru64 and more. &lt;i&gt;Essential System Administration &lt;/i&gt;provides a clear, concise, practical guide to the real-world issues that anyone responsible for a Unix system faces daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new edition of this indispensable reference has been fully updated for all the latest operating systems. Even more importantly, it has been extensively revised and expanded to consider the current system administrative topics that administrators need most. &lt;i&gt;Essential System Administration&lt;/i&gt;,3rd Edition covers: DHCP, USB devices, the latest automation tools, SNMP and network management, LDAP, PAM, and recent security tools and techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Essential System Administration&lt;/i&gt; is comprehensive. But what has made this book the guide system administrators turn to over and over again is not just the sheer volume of valuable information it provides, but the clear, useful way the information is presented.  It discusses the underlying higher-level concepts, but it also provides the details of the procedures needed to carry them out.  It is not organized around the features of the Unix operating system, but around the various facets of a system administrator's job.  It describes all the usual administrative tools that Unix provides, but it also shows how to use them intelligently and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you use a standalone Unix system, routinely provide administrative support for a larger shared system, or just want an understanding of basic administrative functions, &lt;i&gt;Essential System Administration&lt;/i&gt; is for you. This comprehensive and invaluable book combines the author's years of practical experience with technical expertise to help you manage Unix systems as productively and painlessly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Shared Source CLI Essentials</title>
    <author>David Stutz, Ted Neward, Geoff Shilling</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Shared Source CLI (code-named "Rotor") is the publicly available implementation of the ECMA Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and the ECMA C# language specification. Loaded with three million lines of source code, it presents a wealth of programming language technology that targets developers interested in the internal workings of the Microsoft .NET Framework, academics working with advanced compiler technology, and people developing their own CLI implementations. The CLI, at its heart, is an approach to building software that enables code from many independent sources to co-exist and interoperate safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shared Source CLI Essentials&lt;/i&gt; is a companion guide to Rotor's code. This concise and insightful volume provides a road map for anyone wishing to navigate, understand, or alter the Shared Source CLI code. This book illustrates the design principles used in the CLI standard and discusses the complexities involved when building virtual machines. Included with the book is a CD-ROM that contains all the source code and files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After introducing the CLI, its core concepts, and the Shared Source CLI implementation, &lt;i&gt;Shared Source CLI Essentials&lt;/i&gt; covers these topics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The CLI type system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Component packaging and assemblies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type loading and JIT Compilation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed code and the execution engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garbage collection and memory management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Platform Adaptation Layer (PAL): a portability layer for Win32&amp;#174;, Mac OS&amp;#174; X, and FreeBSD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Written by members of the core Microsoft&amp;#174; team that designed the .NET Framework, &lt;i&gt;Shared Source CLI Essentials&lt;/i&gt; is for anyone who wants a deeper understanding of what goes on under the hood of the .NET runtime and the ECMA CLI. Advanced .NET programmers, researchers, the academic community, and CLI implementers who have asked hard questions about the .NET Framework will find that this behind-the-scenes look at the .NET nucleus provides them with excellent resources from which they can extract answers.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how flexible and convenient digital information has become, we haven't done away with the need to see information in print.  Extensible Style Language-Formatting Objects, or XSL-FO, is a set of tools developers and web designers use to describe page printouts of their XML (including XHTML) documents.  If you need to produce high quality printed material from your XML documents, then XSL-FO provides the bridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;XSL-FO&lt;/i&gt; is one of the few books to go beyond a basic introduction to the technology. While many books touch on XSL-FO in their treatment of XSLT, this book offers in-depth coverage of XSL-FO's features and strengths. Author Dave Pawson is well known in the XSLT and XSL-FO communities, and maintains the XSLT FAQ.  An online version of this book has helped many developers master this technology. &lt;i&gt;XSL-FO&lt;/i&gt; is the first time this reference is available in print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the book provides an overview of the technology and introduces the XSL-FO vocabulary. The author discusses how to choose among today's implementations, explains how to describe pages, and shows you what is going on in the processor in terms of layout.  You'll learn about the basics of formatting and layout as well as readability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part focuses on smaller pieces: blocks, inline structures, graphics, color and character level formatting, concluding by showing how to integrate these parts into a coherent whole. &lt;i&gt;XSL-FO&lt;/i&gt; also explores organizational aspects you'll need to consider?how to design your stylesheets strategically rather than letting them evolve on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;XSL-FO&lt;/i&gt; is more than just a guide to the technology; the book teaches you how to think about the formatting of your documents and guides you through the questions you'll need to ask to ensure that your printed documents meet the same high standards as your computer-generated content.  Written for experienced XML developers and web designers, no other book contains as much useful information on this practical technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;That collection of books is a valuable resource for delving into the topics at depth (and at leisure). But when you need an answer fast, the dog-eared book you'll turn to again and again is the new third edition of &lt;i&gt;Webmaster in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concise and portable quick reference distills an immense amount of information on several languages and technologies into one compact reference book. This is one book that will pay for itself a thousand times over in time saved and increased productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Webmaster in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; puts a fast-paced introduction, detailed reference section, and quick reference guide to each technology all within easy reach.  It's packed full of the genuinely useful information a webmaster needs daily, whatever the technology, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;HTTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This thorough, clear, and accessible reference makes it easy to find the information you want about the technologies you use. You'll keep your other books on the shelf; you'll keep &lt;i&gt;Webmaster in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; next to your keyboard.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

Excel features a complete, state-of-the-art integrated development environment for writing, running, testing, and debugging VBA macros.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The VBA programming language, the same programming language used by the other applications in Microsoft Office XP and 2000, as well as by the retail editions of Visual Basic 6.0. The Excel object model, including new objects and new members of existing objects in Excel 2002. Excel exposes nearly all of its functionality through its object model, which is the means by which Excel can be controlled programmatically using VBA. While the Excel object model, with 192 objects, is the second largest among the Office applications, you need to be familiar with only a handful of objects to write effective macros. &lt;i&gt;Writing Excel Macros&lt;/i&gt; focuses on these essential objects, but includes a discussion of many more objects as well.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Writing Excel Macros with VBA, 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt; is written in a terse, no-nonsense manner that is characteristic of Steven Roman's straightforward, practical approach. Instead of a slow-paced tutorial with a lot of handholding, Roman offers the essential information about Excel VBA that you must master to write macros effectively. This tutorial is reinforced by interesting and useful examples that solve common problems you're sure to have encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Writing Excel Macros with VBA, 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt; is the book you need to delve into the basics of Excel VBA programming, enabling you to increase your power and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;To achieve the maximum control and flexibility from Microsoft&amp;#174; Excel often requires careful custom programming using the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) language. &lt;i&gt;Writing Excel Macros with VBA, 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt; offers a solid introduction to writing VBA macros and programs, and will show you how to get more power at the programming level: focusing on programming languages, the Visual Basic Editor, handling code, and the Excel object model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by experts on the Microsoft&amp;#174; .NET programming platform, &lt;i&gt;ADO.NET in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; delivers everything .NET programmers will need to get a jump-start on ADO.NET technology or to sharpen their skills even further. In the tradition of O'Reilly's In a Nutshell Series, &lt;i&gt;ADO.NET in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the most complete and concise source of ADO.NET information available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADO.NET is the suite of data access technologies in the .NET Framework that developers use to build applications services accessing relational data and XML. Connecting to databases is a fundamental part of most applications, whether they are web, Windows&amp;#174;, distributed, client/server, XML Web Services, or something entirely different. But ADO.NET is substantially different from Microsoft's previous data access technologies--including the previous version of ADO--so even experienced developers need to understand the basics of the new disconnected model before they start programming with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current with the .NET Framework 1.1, &lt;i&gt;ADO.NET in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; offers one place to look when you need help with anything related to this essential technology, including a reference to the ADO.NET namespaces and object model. In addition to being a valuable reference, this book provides a concise foundation for programming with ADO.NET and covers a variety of issues that programmers face when developing web applications or Web Services that rely on database access. Using C#, this book presents real world, practical examples that will help you put ADO.NET to work immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered in the book include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An Introduction to ADO.NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connections, Commands and DataReaders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disconnected Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced DataSets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DataViews and Data Binding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML and the DataSet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Included with the book is a Visual Studio .NET add-in that integrates the entire reference directly into your help files. When combining &lt;i&gt;ADO.NET in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; with other books from O'Reilly's .NET In a Nutshell series, you'll have a comprehensive, detailed and independent reference collection that will help you become more productive.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ADO.NET in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the most complete and concise source of ADO.NET information available. Besides being a valuable reference, this book covers a variety of issues that programmers face when developing web applications or web services that rely on database access. Most examples use Microsoft's C# language. The book's CD includes an add-in to integrate the reference with Visual Studio .NET help files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of forms on the web is so commonplace that most user interactions involve some type of form. XForms--a combination of XML and forms--offers a powerful alternative to HTML-based forms. By providing excellent XML integration, including XML Schema, XForms allows developers to create flexible, web-based user-input forms for a wide variety of platforms, including desktop computers, handhelds, information appliances, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;XForms Essentials&lt;/i&gt; is an introduction and practical guide to the new XForms specification.  Written by Micah Dubinko, a member of the W3C XForms working group and an editor of the specification, the book explains the how and why of XForms, showing readers how to take advantage of them without having to write their own code. You'll learn how to integrate XForms with both HTML and XML vocabularies, and how XForms can simplify the connection between client-based user input and server-based processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;XForms Essentials&lt;/i&gt; begins with a general introduction to web forms, including information on history and basic construction of forms. The second part of the book serves as a reference manual to the XForms specification. The third section offers additional hints, guidelines, and techniques for working with XForms.  Topics covered in the book include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;creating XForms files in a text or XML editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;converting existing forms (electronic or paper) to XForms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collecting XML data from users in a user-friendly way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reducing the amount of JavaScript needed within browser interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increasing the security and reliability of your current forms system by combining client-side and server-side checks into a common code base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating interactive websites using the latest standard technology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;XForms Essentials&lt;/i&gt; focuses on the practical application of XForms technology. If you work with forms, HTML, or XML information, &lt;i&gt;XForms Essentials&lt;/i&gt; will provide you with a much simpler route to more sophisticated interactions with users. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web site developers balance their need to collect information about users with their obligation to show respect for their users' privacy. The Platform for Privacy Preferences Project, or P3P, has emerged as a technology that may satisfy the wishes of both parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), P3P gives users more control over the amount of information they disclose about themselves as they browse the Web, and allows web sites to declare to browsers what sort of information they will request of users. The number of web developers using P3P continues to grow. P3P support is now built into the newest browsers, including Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Web Privacy with P3P&lt;/i&gt; explains the P3P protocol and shows web site developers how to configure their sites for P3P compliance. Author Lorrie Faith Cranor, chair of the Platform for Privacy Preferences Project (P3P) Specification Working Group at the W3C and co-author of the P3P1.0 specification, explains the inner workings of the P3P protocol while maintaining a hands-on implementation approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a foreword by Stanford Law professor Lawrence Lessig, the book begins with an introduction to P3P and an overview of online privacy concerns and the laws governing online privacy. Cranor discusses existing privacy technology, such as encryption tools, filters and identity management tools. Next, the book shows you how to P3P-enable your own site. Among the many topics covered are:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;P3P deployment steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P3P policy syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating P3P policies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating and referencing policy reference files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data schemas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Full of examples and case studies, &lt;i&gt;Web Privacy with P3P&lt;/i&gt; delivers practical advice and insider tips. Software developers, privacy consultants, corporate decision-makers, lawyers, public policy-makers, and any individual interested in online privacy issues will find this book a necessary reference.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance has been an important issue for Java developers ever since the first version hit the streets. Over the years, Java performance has improved dramatically, but tuning is essential to get the best results, especially for J2EE applications. You can never have code that runs too fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Peformance Tuning&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd edition provides a comprehensive and indispensable guide to eliminating all types of performance problems. Using many real-life examples to work through the tuning process in detail, JPT shows how tricks such as minimizing object creation and replacing strings with arrays can really pay off in improving your code's performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuning J2EE applications bears many similarities to tuning J2SE apps, but important and specific considerations apply. For this reason, &lt;i&gt;Java Performance Tuning&lt;/i&gt;, Second Edition includes four new chapters: a new chapter on J2EE application tuning in general followed by chapters on tuning JDBC, servlets and JSPs, and EJBs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Performance Tuning&lt;/i&gt; offers common-sense advice about what to tune and what to leave alone, emphasizing techniques that provide big performance gains with minimal code restructuring. It gives you crucial guidance that helps you tune without destroying your program's architecture. Blindly changing things in an effort to make a program run faster is a great way to create buggy, unmaintainable code. &lt;i&gt;Java Performance Tuning&lt;/i&gt; teaches you to work efficiently and effectively, resulting in code that is robust, maintainable, and fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Performance Tuning&lt;/i&gt;, Second Edition shows you how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a performance plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glean information about your program's behavior from profiling tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify bottlenecks before tuning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize the number of objects your program creates, particularly critical for J2EE applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize the use of strings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid performance penalties from inefficient code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the behavior of loops and switches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize I/O behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use appropriate algorithms for sorting and other common tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use threads effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize the performance of distributed systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed up servlets and JSPs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structure JDBC usage efficiently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use effective design patterns to optimize EJB performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covers JDK 1.4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

It is in the fourth stage --"the expert stage"-- where things really get interesting, and &lt;i&gt;Java Enterprise Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; is the tangible compendium of experience that developers need to breeze through this fourth and final stage of Enterprise Java mastery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crammed with tips and tricks, &lt;i&gt;Java Enterprise Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; distills years of solid experience from eleven experts in the J2EE environment into a practical, to-the-point guide to J2EE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Enterprise Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; gives developers the unvarnished, expert-tested advice that the man pages don't provide--what areas of the APIs should be used frequently (and which are better avoided); elegant solutions to problems you face that other developers have already discovered; what things you should always do, what things you should consider doing, and what things you should never do--even if the documentation says it's ok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until &lt;i&gt;Java Enterprise Best Practices&lt;/i&gt;, Java developers in the fourth stage of mastery relied on the advice of a loose-knit community of fellow developers, time-consuming online searches for examples or suggestions for the immediate problem they faced, and tedious trial-and-error. But Java has grown to include a huge number of APIs, classes, and methods. Now it is simply too large for even the most intrepid developer to know it all.  The need for a written compendium of J2EE Best Practices has never been greater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Enterprise Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; focuses on the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) APIs. The J2EE APIs include such alphabet soup acronyms as EJB, JDBC, RMI, XML, and JMX.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Learning Visual Basic .NET</title>
    <author>Jesse Liberty</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Visual Basic .NET books are written for experienced object-oriented programmers, but many programmers jumping on the .NET bandwagon are coming from non-object-oriented languages, such as Visual Basic 6.0 or from script programming, such as JavaScript.  These programmers, and those who are adopting VB.NET as their first programming language, have been out of luck when it comes to finding a high-quality introduction to the language that helps them get started. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why Jesse Liberty, author of the best-selling books &lt;i&gt;Programming C#&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Programming ASP.NET&lt;/i&gt;, has written an entry-level guide to Visual Basic .NET.  Written in a warm and friendly manner, this book assumes no prior programming experience, and provides an easy introduction to Microsoft's most popular .NET language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning Visual Basic .NET&lt;/i&gt; is a complete introduction to VB.NET and object-oriented programming. This book will help you build a solid foundation in .NET, and show how to apply your skills by using hundreds of examples to help you become productive quickly. &lt;i&gt;Learning Visual Basic .NET&lt;/i&gt; introduces fundamentals like Visual Studio .NET, a tool set for building Windows and Web applications. You'll learn about the syntax and structure of the Visual Basic .NET language, including operators, classes and interfaces, structs, arrays, and strings. Liberty then demonstrates how to develop various kinds of applications--including those that work with databases--and web services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you've finished &lt;i&gt;Learning Visual Basic .NET&lt;/i&gt;, you'll be ready to move on to a more advanced programming guide that will help you create large-scale web and Windows applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you have a little object-oriented programming experience or you are new to programming altogether, Visual Basic .NET will set you firmly on your way to mastering the essentials of the VB.NET language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Java Extreme Programming Cookbook</title>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme Programming does not mean programming naked while rollerblading down the side of the Grand Canyon.  It does mean a new approach to software development that is both radical and common-sense.  Unlike many software development methodologies, XP has been accepted quickly because its core practices--particularly code sharing, test-first development, and continuous integration--resonated immediately with software developers everywhere.  Instead of impressing developers with a body of theory, XP got programmers to say, "Yeah, that's how I'd like to work."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, although most developers turn to Extreme Programming methods in order to code real, hands-on, and extensible projects quickly ("Code comes first"), most books on Extreme Programming insist on focusing on the theory and not the practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the &lt;i&gt;Java Extreme Programming Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brimming with over 100 "recipes" for getting down to business and actually doing XP,  the &lt;i&gt;Java Extreme Programming Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;  doesn't try to "sell" you on XP; it succinctly documents the most important features of popular open source tools for XP in Java--including Ant, Junit, HttpUnit, Cactus, Tomcat, XDoclet--and then digs right in, providing recipes for implementing the tools in real-world environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each recipe offers solutions that help you put an extreme programming environment together: then provides code for automating the build process and testing. Although the time saved using any one of these solutions will more than pay for the book, &lt;i&gt;Java Extreme Programming Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; offers more than just a collection of cut-and-paste code.  Each recipe also includes explanations of how and why the approach works, so you can adapt the techniques to similar situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges facing developers today is sorting through the wide variety of tools available form various source and figuring out how to them effectively. The recipes in &lt;i&gt;Java Extreme Programming Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; showcase how to use the most important features of these XP tools. Many of these tools are geared towards unit testing, while others are invaluable for continuous integration; with these practical examples, you'll be able to choose the most effective tools to accomplish your goals, then implement them in a cohesive development environment quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to set up a test-driven development environment that allows you to focus on writing testable code--now--this book will prove invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer security is an ongoing process, a relentless contest between system administrators and intruders.  A good administrator needs to stay one step ahead of any adversaries, which often involves a continuing process of education. If you're grounded in the basics of security, however, you won't necessarily want a complete treatise on the subject each time you pick up a book. Sometimes you want to get straight to the point. That's exactly what the new &lt;i&gt;Linux Security Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; does.  Rather than provide a total security solution for Linux computers, the authors present a series of easy-to-follow recipes--short, focused pieces of code that administrators can use to improve security and perform common tasks securely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Linux Security Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; includes real solutions to a wide range of targeted problems, such as sending encrypted email within Emacs, restricting access to network services at particular times of day, firewalling a webserver, preventing IP spoofing, setting up key-based SSH authentication, and much more.  With over 150 ready-to-use scripts and configuration files, this unique book helps administrators secure their systems without having to look up specific syntax. The book begins with recipes devised to establish a secure system, then moves on to secure day-to-day practices, and concludes with techniques to help your system stay secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the "recipes" you'll find in this book are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Controlling access to your system from firewalls down to individual services, using iptables, ipchains, xinetd, inetd, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring your network with tcpdump, dsniff, netstat, and other tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protecting network connections with Secure Shell (SSH) and stunnel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safeguarding email sessions with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypting files and email messages with GnuPG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probing your own security with password crackers, nmap, and handy scripts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
This cookbook's proven techniques are derived from hard-won experience. Whether you're responsible for security on a home Linux system or for a large corporation, or somewhere in between, you'll find valuable, to-the-point, practical recipes for dealing with everyday security issues. This book is a system saver.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C++</title>
    <author>John Viega, Matt Messier</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Password sniffing, spoofing, buffer overflows, and denial of service: these are only a few of the attacks on today's computer systems and networks. At the root of this epidemic is poorly written, poorly tested, and insecure code that puts everyone at risk. Clearly, today's developers need help figuring out how to write code that attackers won't be able to exploit. But writing such code is surprisingly difficult.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C++&lt;/i&gt; is an important new resource for developers serious about writing secure code. It contains a wealth of solutions to problems faced by those who care about the security of their applications. It covers a wide range of topics, including safe initialization, access control, input validation, symmetric and public key cryptography, cryptographic hashes and MACs, authentication and key exchange, PKI, random numbers, and anti-tampering. The rich set of code samples provided in the book's more than 200 recipes will help programmers secure the C and C++ programs they write for both Unix&amp;#174; (including Linux&amp;#174;) and Windows&amp;#174; environments. Readers will learn:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to avoid common programming errors, such as buffer overflows, race conditions, and format string problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to properly SSL-enable applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to create secure channels for client-server communication without SSL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to integrate Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) into applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best practices for using cryptography properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Techniques and strategies for properly validating input to programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to launch programs securely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use file access mechanisms properly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Techniques for protecting applications from reverse engineering&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The book's web site supplements the book by providing a place to post new recipes, including those written in additional languages like Perl, Java, and Python. Monthly prizes will reward the best recipes submitted by readers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Secure Programming Cookbook for C and C++&lt;/i&gt; is destined to become an essential part of any developer's library, a code companion developers will turn to again and again as they seek to protect their systems from  attackers and reduce the risks they face in today's dangerous world.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated to cover Flash MX, the newest version of Macromedia Flash, &lt;i&gt;ActionScript for Flash MX: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt;, Second Edition is the one book no serious Flash developer should be without.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ActionScript is Macromedia's programming language for Flash MX, the popular authoring tool for creating rich internet applications and animations for the Web.  With Macromedia's new focus on application development, ActionScript now includes a direct drawing API, loading of external MP3 and JPG files, improved sound control, an extensive set of text formatting tools, complete support for component development using movie clip subclasses, local data storage, accessibility features, and much more.  And &lt;i&gt;ActionScript for Flash MX: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; is the most complete, up-to-date reference available for the latest version of this language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Colin Moock, one of the most universally respected developers in the Flash community, has added hundreds of new code examples to show new Flash MX techniques in the real world:  how to draw circles, save data to disk, convert arrays to onscreen tables, create reusable components, and preload variables, XML, and sounds.  The book's language reference alone has nearly doubled from the first edition, with more than 250 new classes, objects, methods, and properties.  You'll find exhaustive coverage of dozens of undocumented, under-documented, and mis-documented features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the new material, Colin Moock has meticulously revised the entire text to conform to Flash MX best-coding practices.  In particular, objected-oriented programming and the new event model get special attention in light of changes to Flash MX ActionScript.  From sending data between two movies to creating getter/setter properties, the new edition of this book demystifies the often-confusing new features of Flash MX, giving developers easy access to its powerful new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ActionScript for Flash MX: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; is structured so non-programmers can learn how to use ActionScript and programmers can take their skills to new heights.  If you are in the market to really learn about the hows and whys of ActionScript, then this is the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>.NET &amp; XML</title>
    <author>Niel M. Bornstein</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're seeking ways to build network-based applications or XML-based web services, Microsoft provides most of the tools you'll need. XML is integrated into the .NET Framework and Visual Studio .NET, but if you want to get a grasp on how .NET and XML actually work together, that's a different story.  With &lt;i&gt;.NET &amp;amp; XML&lt;/i&gt;, you can get under the hood to see how the .NET Framework implements XML, giving you the skills to write understandable XML-based code that interoperates with code written with other tools, and even other languages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;.NET &amp;amp; XML&lt;/i&gt; starts by introducing XML and the .NET Framework, and then teaches you how to read and write XML before moving on to complex methods for manipulating, navigating, transforming, and constraining it. To demonstrate the power of XML in .NET, author Niel Bornstein builds a simple hardware store inventory system throughout the book. As you move from chapter to chapter, you'll absorb increasingly complex information until you have enough knowledge to successfully program your own XML-based applications. This tutorial also contains a quick reference to the API, plus appendices present additional .NET assemblies that you can use to work with XML, and how to work with the .NET XML configuration file format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study puts the potential market for new software based on XML at or near $100 billion over the next five years. The .NET Framework gives you a way to become a part of it. But to use XML and .NET effectively, you need to understand how these two technologies work together. This book gives you the insight to take full advantage of the power the two provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;.NET &amp;amp; XML&lt;/i&gt; provides an in-depth, concentrated tutorial for intermediate to advanced-level developers.  Additionally, it includes a complete reference to the XML-related namespaces within the .NET Framework. XML is an extremely flexible technology, and Microsoft has implemented most of the tools programmers need to use it very extensively. &lt;i&gt;.NET &amp;amp; XML&lt;/i&gt; aims to help you understand the intersection between the two technologies for maximum effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Web Services in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is a high-speed tutorial and a quick reference for the technologies that Sun Microsystems is creating for implementing web services with Java. This book is a succinct introduction and handy reference to the Java/XML APIs, more commonly known as the JWSDP or "Java Web Services Development Pack."  These APIs are taking the Java world by storm, as they are capable of handling everything from simple XML to SOAP to full ebXML vocabularies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although "web services" technology has suffered from much hype and overly grand expectations, there is plenty of solid development going on, especially in extending enterprise applications, and a huge amount of this development is being done in Java.  As a result, the J2EE APIs for web services are evolving rapidly, and this new "in a Nutshell" book covers them all in depth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important APIs in the JWSDP is JAX-RPC (Java API for XML-based RPC). It's also the API that developers most consistently post questions about. &lt;i&gt;Java Web Services in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; covers all aspects of JAX-RPC in detail, with tutorial coverage alone exceeding 150 pages. This book offers developers everything they need to program with JAX-RPC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Web Services in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; begins with an introduction to Java web services, including a discussion of how they differ from web applications. The author looks at the protocols and interfaces that underpin web services, the J2EE technologies that address web services, WSDL as the means for describe web services, and more. Subsequent chapters cover:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;JAX-RPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOAP and the SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable SOAP messaging with JAXM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WSDL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced JAX-RPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JAXR, the XML-based registry API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Services Tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The balance of the book is made up of an API Quick Reference containing documentation for the various API packages.
&lt;p&gt;Intended for Java developers who need to implement Java services or who need their applications to access existing web services, &lt;i&gt;Java Web Services in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; delivers practical information to help developers make sense of the rapidly changing and poorly organized official documentation. If web services and Enterprise Java are any part of your job description -- of if you'd like them to be -- you'll want this book close beside as you work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mac OS X for Java Geeks&lt;/i&gt; delivers a complete and detailed look at the Mac OS X platform, geared specifically at Java developers. Programmers using the 10.2 (Jaguar) release of Mac OS X, and the new JDK 1.4, have unprecedented new functionality available to them. Whether you are a Java newbie, working your way through Java Swing and classpath issues, or you are a Java guru, comfortable with digital media, reflection, and J2EE, this book will teach you how to get around on Mac OS X. You'll also get the latest information on how to build applications that run seamlessly, and identically, on Windows, Linux, Unix, and the Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book begins by laying out the Mac OS X tool set, from the included Java Runtime Environment to third-party tools IDEs and Jakarta Ant. You'll then be brought up to speed on the advanced, Mac-specific extensions to Java, including the spelling framework, speech framework, and integration with QuickTime. In addition to clear explanations of these extensions, you'll learn how to write code that falls back to non-Mac specific code when it runs on other platforms, keeping your application portable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have the fundamentals of the Mac OS X Java platform in hand, this book takes you beyond the basics. You'll learn how to get the Apache web server running, and supplement it with the Jakarta Tomcat JSP and servlet container. JSPs and servlets running on Mac OS X are covered, as is installation and connectivity to a database. Once you have your web applications up and running, you'll learn how to interface them with EJBs, as running the JBoss application server on Mac OS X is covered.

    <title>Flash Remoting: The Definitive Guide</title>
    <author>Tom Muck</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flash Remoting MX lets developers easily integrate rich Macromedia Flash content with applications that are built using Macromedia ColdFusion MX, Microsoft .NET, Java, PHP, or SOAP-based web services. The result is complex client/server applications that more closely resemble desktop applications than traditional web pages. Gone is the click/wait/reload approach of HTML. Your web application uses Flash as the front end while Flash Remoting handles the communication behind the scenes with the application server.  All the end user knows is that it's fast and flexible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential uses for Flash Remoting are endless. &lt;i&gt;Flash Remoting: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; will help you understand this breakthrough technology and use it to build your own Rich Internet Applications (RIAs). Build applications  that connect to a database, file system, or other server-side technologies. Or, use Flash Remoting to create:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;online stores that feature catalogs and shopping cart systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sound and video clip libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;banner ads with built-in shopping carts, click-through tracking, and site search capabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new controls that can be used in place of HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extensions to Flash, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;front-ends to databases for administrators&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The book begins with Flash Remoting basics: setup, installation and an introduction to its underlying concepts.  Next, you'll explore the Flash's User Interface components as they relate to Flash Remoting. Then, you'll gain insights into Flash Remoting internals and the Remoting API. The book is rich with examples that you will be able to run on your own system.
&lt;p&gt;The next section focuses on the server-side environment that you'll use for your applications. Individual chapters cover Flash Remoting with ColdFusion, Server-Side ActionScript, Java, ASP.NET, and PHP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last section covers more advanced Flash Remoting techniques, such as calling web services from Flash Remoting, extending objects and UI controls, best practices, and debugging. Plus there is a detailed chapter demonstrating a real-world application. The book concludes with a Flash Remoting API reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers who are looking to create Rich Internet Applications with Flash will find &lt;i&gt;Flash Remoting: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; indispensable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Kerberos: The Definitive Guide</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerberos, the single sign-on authentication system originally developed at MIT, deserves its name.  It's a faithful watchdog that keeps intruders out of your networks. But it has been equally fierce to system administrators, for whom the complexity of Kerberos is legendary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single sign-on is the holy grail of network administration, and Kerberos is the only game in town.  Microsoft, by integrating Kerberos into Active Directory in Windows 2000 and 2003, has extended the reach of Kerberos to all networks large or small.  Kerberos makes your network more secure and more convenient for users by providing a single authentication system that works across the entire network. One username; one password; one login is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, help for administrators is on the way.  &lt;i&gt;Kerberos: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to implement Kerberos for secure authentication.  In addition to covering the basic principles behind cryptographic authentication, it covers everything from basic installation to advanced topics like cross-realm authentication, defending against attacks on Kerberos, and troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to covering Microsoft's Active Directory implementation, &lt;i&gt;Kerberos: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; covers both major implementations of Kerberos for Unix and Linux: MIT and Heimdal.  It shows you how to set up Mac OS X as a Kerberos client.  The book also covers both versions of the Kerberos protocol that are still in use: Kerberos 4 (now obsolete) and Kerberos 5, paying special attention to the integration between the different protocols, and between Unix and Windows implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been avoiding Kerberos because it's confusing and poorly documented, it's time to get on board!  This book shows you how to put Kerberos authentication to work on your Windows and Unix systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you've decided to adopt Windows Server 2003? Whether you're migrating from Windows 2000 or directly from Windows NT, &lt;i&gt;Windows Server 2003 in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;  is packed with the detailed information that you will need as you administer this OS. To-the-point chapters on migration highlight important new features such as enhancements to Active Directory, shadow volume copies, and Windows Update. Even better for experienced NT and 2000 admins are details about where Microsoft put familiar options, helping you quickly get oriented to the new platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you familiar with NT or Windows 2000 are well beyond the tutorial stage. &lt;i&gt;Windows Server 2003 in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; delivers a no-fluff guide with two alphabetical references, one for the GUI and one for the command-line. The Task Map chapter lets you find look up a task (such as "troubleshooting startup issues") to find appropriate topics in the references. Once you know where you're going, the book offers numerous step-by-step procedures in highly condensed form. This quick lookup reference is ideal for administration and deployment, as well as deeper issues such as planning, configuring, and troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GUI chapter is organized by topic according to major themes of Windows Server 2003 administration, providing one-stop shopping for busy admins. For example, if you want to find out about Active Directory and how to manage it, you'd begin by turning to Active Directory. Each topic begins with a description of basic concepts, followed by a description of tools (such as Microsoft Management Console snap-ins) used to administer the feature, instructions on how to perform common or important administrative tasks, and notes detailing subtle points and potential gotchas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Server 2003 offers greatly enhanced command-line administration, and the command reference prominently highlights the many new commands in this release. Dozens of new commands and scripts have been added for administration of Active Directory, disks, event logs, Group Policy, IIS, network diagnostics, the pagefile, printers, processes, shared folders, and the Registry. The result is a Windows operating system platform that now rivals Unix in its ability to support command-line and scripted administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has introduced the right server for a world now dominated by highly distributed systems and web-based server applications, and O'Reilly has written a book that will earn a prominent place on administrators' desk tops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a geek and a PC, add one soldering iron, a home, and a copy of &lt;i&gt;Home Hacking Projects for Geeks&lt;/i&gt;, and you'll give new meaning to the term, "home improvement." From fearless neophytes to tool-wielding masterminds, the home hacker in any geek will find new inspiration and plenty of hands-on guidance to take on a variety of home-transforming projects once relegated to the world of sci-fi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fun new guide combines creativity with electricity and power tools to achieve cool--and sometimes even practical--home automation projects.  Never again will you have to flip a light switch when you enter a room or use a key to open your front door.  With a few off-the-shelf devices, some homemade hardware, and a little imagination, you can be living in your own high-tech habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Home Hacking Projects for Geeks&lt;/i&gt; shows hackers of all ability levels how to take on a wide range of projects, from the relatively small but energy-conscious automating of light switches, to building home theaters using Windows or Linux-based PCs, to more complicated projects like building home security systems that rival those offered by professional security consultants.  Each project includes a conceptual diagram, a "What You Need List" and a small "Project Stats" section that describes the relative difficulty, time involved, and cost of the project.  What's more, each project is a workable, practical way to improve your home--something unique that you can customize for your individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thirteen projects in &lt;i&gt;Home Hacking Projects for Geeks&lt;/i&gt; are divided into three categories: Home Automation, Home Entertainment Systems, and Security, and include projects such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remotely Monitor Your Pet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Your House Talk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remotely Control Your Computer's MP3 player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Time-Shifted FM Radio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch Your House Across the Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a Home Security System&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If you've ever thought the Jetsons had it made, or looked around your house and thought, "I could make that better " then you're ready for &lt;i&gt;Home Hacking Projects for Geeks&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Home Hacking Projects for Geeks&lt;/i&gt; presents a wide range of projects from automating of light switches, to building home theaters using Windows or Linux-based PCs, to building home security systems that rival those offered by professional security consultants.

    <author>Steve Oualline</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;C++ is a powerful, highly flexible, and adaptable programming language that allows software engineers to organize and process information quickly and effectively. But this high-level language is relatively difficult to master, even if you already know the C programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2nd edition of &lt;i&gt;Practical C++ Programming&lt;/i&gt; is a complete introduction to the C++ language for programmers who are learning C++. Reflecting the latest changes to the C++ standard, this 2nd edition takes a useful down-to-earth approach, placing a strong emphasis on how to design clean, elegant code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, to-the-point chapters, all aspects of programming are covered including style, software engineering, programming design, object-oriented design, and debugging.  It also covers common mistakes and how to find (and avoid) them. End of chapter exercises help you ensure you've mastered the material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical C++ Programming thoroughly covers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;C++ Syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coding standards and style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation and use of object classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging and optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of the C++ preprocessor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File input/output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Steve Oualline's clear, easy-going writing style and hands-on approach to learning make &lt;i&gt;Practical C++ Programming&lt;/i&gt; a nearly painless way to master this complex but powerful programming language. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This second edition of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Learning XML&lt;/i&gt; provides web developers with a concise but grounded understanding of XML (the Extensible Markup Language) and its potential-- not just a whirlwind tour of XML.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author explains the important and relevant XML technologies and their capabilities clearly and succinctly with plenty of real-life projects and useful examples. He outlines the elements of markup--demystifying concepts such as attributes, entities, and namespaces--and provides enough depth and examples to get started.  &lt;i&gt;Learning XML&lt;/i&gt; is a reliable source for anyone who needs to know XML, but doesn't want to waste time wading through hundreds of web sites or 800 pages of bloated text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For writers producing XML documents, this book clarifies files and the process of creating them with the appropriate structure and format. Designers will learn what parts of XML are most helpful to their team and will get started on creating Document Type Definitions. For programmers, the book makes syntax and structures clear. &lt;i&gt;Learning XML&lt;/i&gt;  also discusses the stylesheets needed for viewing documents in the next generation of browsers, databases, and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning XML&lt;/i&gt; illustrates the core XML concepts and language syntax, in addition to important related tools such as the CSS and XSL styling languages and the XLink and XPointer specifications for creating rich link structures. It includes information about three schema languages for validation: W3C Schema, Schematron, and RELAX-NG, which are gaining widespread support from people who need to validate documents but aren't satisfied with DTDs. Also new in this edition is a chapter on XSL-FO, a powerful formatting language for XML. If you need to wade through the acronym soup of XML and start to really use this powerful tool, &lt;i&gt;Learning XML&lt;/i&gt;, will give you the roadmap you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>RELAX NG</title>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As developers know, the beauty of XML is that it is extensible, even to the point that you can invent new elements and attributes as you write XML documents.  Then, however, you need to define your changes so that applications will be able to make sense of them and this is where XML schema languages come into play. RELAX NG (pronounced relaxing), the Regular Language Description for XML Core--New Generation is quickly gaining momentum as an alternative to other schema languages.  Designed to solve a variety of common problems raised in the creation and sharing of XML vocabularies, RELAX NG is less complex than The W3C's XML Schema Recommendation and much more powerful and flexible than DTDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RELAX NG is a grammar-based schema language that's both easy to learn for schema creators and easy to implement for software developers In &lt;i&gt;RELAX NG&lt;/i&gt;, developers are introduced to this unique language and will learn a no-nonsense method for creating XML schemas. This book offers a clear-cut explanation of RELAX NG that enables intermediate and advanced XML developers to focus on XML document structures and content rather than battle the intricacies of yet another convoluted standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;RELAX NG&lt;/i&gt; covers the following topics in depth:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction to RELAX NG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building RELAX NG schemas using XML syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building RELAX NG schemas using compact syntax, an alternative non-XML syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flattening schemas to limit depth and provide reusability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using external datatype libraries with RELAX NG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W3C XML Schema regular expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing extensible schemas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Annotating schemas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating schemas form different sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determinism and datatype assignment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
and much more.
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a schema language that's easy to use and won't leave you in a labyrinth of obscure limitations, RELAX NG is the language you should be using.  And only O'Reilly's &lt;i&gt;RELAX NG&lt;/i&gt; gives you the straightforward information and everything else you'll need to take advantage of this powerful and intelligible language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architects of buildings and architects of software have more in common than most people think. Both professions require attention to detail, and both practitioners will see their work collapse around them if they make too many mistakes.  It's impossible to imagine a world in which buildings get built without blueprints, but it's still common for software applications to be designed and built without blueprints, or in this case, design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software design pattern can be identified as "a recurring solution to a recurring problem." Using design patterns for software development makes sense in the same way that architectural design patterns make sense--if it works well in one place, why not use it in another?  But developers have had enough of books that simply catalog design patterns without extending into new areas, and books that are so theoretical that you can't actually do anything better after reading them than you could before you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crawford and Kaplan's &lt;i&gt;J2EE Design Patterns&lt;/i&gt; approaches the subject in a unique, highly practical and pragmatic way. Rather than simply present another catalog of design patterns, the authors broaden the scope by discussing ways to choose design patterns when building an enterprise application from scratch, looking closely at the real world tradeoffs that Java developers must weigh when architecting their applications. Then they go on to show how to apply the patterns when writing realworld software.  They also extend design patterns into areas not covered in other books, presenting original patterns for data modeling, transaction / process modeling, and interoperability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;J2EE Design Patterns&lt;/i&gt; offers extensive coverage of the five problem areas enterprise developers face:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintenance (Extensibility)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance (System Scalability)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Modeling (Business Object Modeling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transactions (process Modeling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging (Interoperability)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
And with its careful balance between theory and practice, &lt;i&gt;J2EE Design Patterns&lt;/i&gt; will give developers new to the Java enterprise development arena a solid understanding of how to approach a wide variety of architectural and procedural problems, and will give experienced J2EE pros an opportunity to extend and improve on their existing experience. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Programming .NET Security</title>
    <author>Adam Freeman, Allen Jones</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the spread of web-enabled desktop clients and web-server based applications, developers can no longer afford to treat security as an afterthought. It's one topic, in fact, that .NET forces you to address, since Microsoft has placed security-related features at the core of the .NET Framework. Yet, because a developer's carelessness or lack of experience can still allow a program to be used in an unintended way, &lt;i&gt;Programming .NET Security&lt;/i&gt; shows you how the various tools will help you write secure applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book works as both a comprehensive tutorial and reference to security issues for .NET application development, and contains numerous practical examples in both the C# and VB.NET languages. With &lt;i&gt;Programming .NET Security&lt;/i&gt;, you will learn to apply sound security principles to your application designs, and to understand the concepts of identity, authentication and authorization and how they apply to .NET security. This guide also teaches you to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;use the .NET run-time security features and .NET security namespaces and types to implement best-practices in your applications, including evidence,  permissions, code identity and security policy, and role based and Code Access Security (CAS) use the .NET cryptographic APIs , from hashing and common encryption algorithms to digital signatures and cryptographic keys, to protect your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use COM+ component services in a secure manner&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If you program with ASP.NET will also learn how to apply security to your applications.  And the book also shows you how to use the Windows Event Log Service to audit Windows security violations that may be a threat to your solution.
&lt;p&gt;Authors Adam Freeman and Allen Jones, early .NET adopters and long-time proponents of an "end-to-end" security model, based this book on their years of experience in applying security policies and developing products for NASDAQ, Sun Microsystems, Netscape, Microsoft, and others. With the .NET platform placing security at center stage, the better informed you are, the more secure your project will be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Macintosh Troubleshooting Pocket Guide for Mac OS</title>
    <author>David Lerner, Aaron Freimark, Tekserve Corporation</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The press has called Tekserve Corporation, the idiosyncratic Macintosh repair store in New York City,  "The Epicenter of Mac Culture in NYC",  "The leader in Apple triage services" and "warm and eclectic - maybe even a little eccentric". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not everyone can get down to Tekserve's West 23rd St location for the clear, down-to-earth Mac troubleshooting advice that Tekserve's owners dispense.  For the rest of us, O'Reilly &amp;amp; Associates has published the &lt;i&gt;Macintosh Troubleshooting Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; ($12.95)  written by David Lerner and Aaron Freimark, of "the world's best Macintosh repair shop".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This slim pocket guide has the answers to frequently asked Macintosh troubleshooting questions. Imagine the quirky record store in the movie "High Fidelity," or the popular "Car Talk" show on National Public Radio, and you'll have a good idea of this book's flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tekserver has long provided its customers with a free "Frequently Asked Questions" document.  We recently discovered this FAQ sheet and realized that-- like New York itself-- it was too good to leave just for the New Yorkers. With the help of Tekserve, we turned this FAQ sheet into the &lt;i&gt;Macintosh Troubleshooting Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Macintosh Troubleshooting Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; covers the most common user hardware and software trouble, from disks stuck in drives to lost files. It's not just a book for Mac OS X (although it includes tips for OS X and Jaguar, the latest release), it's for anyone who owns a Mac of any type-- there are software tips going back as far as OS 6.  The &lt;i&gt;Macintosh Troubleshooting Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; distills the answers to the urgent questions that Tekserve's employee's answer every week into a handy guide that fits in your back pocket or alongside your keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;JDBC--the Java Database Connectivity specification--is a complex set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers need to understand if they want their Java applications to work with databases.  JDBC is so complex that even the most experienced developers need to refresh their memories from time to time on specific methods and details.  But, practically speaking, who wants to stop and thumb through a weighty tutorial volume each time a question arises?  The answer is the &lt;i&gt;JDBC Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt;, a data-packed quick reference that is both a time-saver and a lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;JDBC Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; offers quick look-ups for all methods of the standard JDBC classes.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A competent system administrator knows that a Linux server is a high performance system for routing large amounts of information through a network connection.  Setting up and maintaining a Linux server requires understanding not only the hardware, but the ins and outs of the Linux operating system along with its supporting cast of utilities as well as layers of applications software.  There's basic documentation online but there's a lot beyond the basics you have to know, and this only comes from people with hands-on, real-world experience.  This kind of  "know how" is what we sought to capture in &lt;i&gt;Linux Server Hacks&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Linux Server Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of 100 industrial-strength hacks, providing tips and tools that solve practical problems for Linux system administrators.  Every hack can be read in just a few minutes but will save hours of searching for the right answer. Some of the hacks are subtle, many of them are non-obvious, and all of them demonstrate the power and flexibility of a Linux system.   You'll find hacks devoted to tuning the Linux kernel to make your system run more efficiently, as well as using CVS or RCS to track the revision to system files. You'll learn alternative ways to do backups, how to use system monitoring tools to track system performance and a variety of secure networking solutions. &lt;i&gt;Linux Server Hacks&lt;/i&gt; also helps you manage large-scale Web installations running Apache, MySQL, and other open source tools that are typically part of a Linux system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly's new Hacks Series proudly reclaims the term "hacking" for the good guys. Hackers use their ingenuity to solve interesting problems.  Rob Flickenger is an experienced system administrator, having managed the systems for O'Reilly Network for several years.  (He's also into community wireless networking and he's written a book on that subject for O'Reilly.) Rob has also collected the best ideas and tools from a number of other highly skilled contributors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written for users who already understand the basics, &lt;i&gt;Linux Server Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is built upon the expertise of people who really know what they're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocoa&amp;#174; is more than just a collection of classes, and is certainly more than a simple framework. Cocoa is a complete API set, class library, framework, and development environment for building applications and tools to run on Mac OS&amp;#174; X. With over 240 classes, Cocoa is divided into two essential frameworks: Foundation and Application Kit. Above all else, Cocoa is a toolkit for creating Mac OS X application interfaces, and it provides access to all of the standard Aqua&amp;#174; interface components such as menus, toolbars, windows, buttons, to name a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cocoa in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; begins with a complete overview of Cocoa's object classes. It provides developers who may be experienced with other application toolkits the grounding they'll need to start developing Cocoa applications. Common programming tasks are described, and many chapters focus on the larger patterns in the frameworks so developers can understand the larger relationships between the classes in Cocoa, which is essential to using the framework effectively.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cocoa in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is divided into two parts, with the first part providing a series of overview chapters that describe specific features of the Cocoa frameworks. Information you'll find in Part I includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An overview of the Objective-C language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coverage of the Foundation and Application Kit frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overviews of Cocoa's drawing and text handling classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network services such as hosts, Rendezvous URL services, sockets, and file handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed notifications and distributed objects for interapplication communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extending Cocoa applications with other frameworks, including the AddressBook, DiscRecording, and Messaging frameworks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The second half of the book is a detailed quick reference to Cocoa's Foundation and Application Kit (AppKit) classes. A complement to Apple's documentation, &lt;i&gt;Cocoa in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the only reference to the classes, functions, types, constants, protocols, and methods that make up Cocoa's Foundation and Application Kit frameworks, based on the Jaguar release (Mac OS X 10.2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Peer-reviewed and approved by Apple's engineers to be part of the Apple Developer Connection (ADC) Series, &lt;i&gt;Cocoa in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the book developers will want close at hand as they work. It's the desktop quick reference they can keep by their side to look something up quickly without leaving their work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cocoa in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the book developers will want close at hand as they work.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More often than not, the words "sendmail configuration" strike dread in the hearts of sendmail and system administrators--and not without reason. sendmail configuration languages are as complex as any other programming languages, but used much more infrequently--only when sendmail is installed or configured. The average system administrator doesn't get enough practice to truly master this inscrutable technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there's help. The &lt;i&gt;sendmail Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; provides step-by-step solutions for the administrator who needs to solve configuration problems fast. Say you need to configure sendmail to relay mail for your clients without creating an open relay that will be abused by spammers. A recipe in the Cookbook shows you how to do just that. No more wading through pages of dense documentation and tutorials and creating your own custom solution--just go directly to the recipe that addresses your specific problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each recipe in the &lt;i&gt;sendmail Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; outlines a configuration problem, presents the configuration code that solves that problem, and then explains the code in detail. The discussion of the code is critical because it provides the insight you need to tweak the code for your own circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;sendmail Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; begins with an overview of the configuration languages, offering a quick how-to for downloading and compiling the sendmail distribution. Next, you'll find a baseline configuration recipe upon which many of the subsequent configurations, or recipes, in the book are based. Recipes in the following chapters stand on their own and offer solutions for properly configuring important sendmail functions such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delivering and forwarding mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relaying&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Masquerading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routing mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling spam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing the mail transport&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing the queue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing sendmail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;sendmail Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is more than just a new approach to discussing sendmail configuration. The book also provides lots of new material that doesn't get much coverage elsewhere--STARTTLS and AUTH are given entire chapters, and LDAP is covered in recipes throughout the book. But most of all, this book is about saving time--something that most system administrators have in short supply. Pick up the &lt;i&gt;sendmail Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; and say good-bye to sendmail dread. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich Text Format, or RTF, is the internal markup language used by Microsoft Word and understood by dozens of other word processors. RTF is a universal file format that pervades practically every desktop. Because RTF is text, it's much easier to generate and process than binary .doc files.  Any programmer working with word processing documents needs to learn enough RTF to get around, whether it's to format text for Word (or almost any other word processor), to make global changes to an existing document, or to convert Word files to (or from) another format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;RTF Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; is a concise and easy-to-use tutorial and quick-reference for anyone who occasionally ends up mired in RTF files. As the first published book to cover the RTF format in any detail, this small pocket guide explains the syntax of RTF with examples throughout, including special sections on Unicode RTF and MSHelp RTF, and several full programs that demonstrate how to work in RTF effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most word processors produce RTF documents consisting of arcane and redundant markup.  This book is the first step to finding order in the disorder of RTF. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Any programmer working with text files today needs a way to deal with Microsoft&amp;#174; Word documents and their underlying Rich Text Format. RTF is notoriously difficult to work with, and our handy quick reference is the only book available on what many developers call "this maddeningly unstructured format." Small and easy to use on the job, &lt;i&gt;RTF Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; focuses on the "workhorse" codes that programmers can't do without, including text style codes, paragraph formatting codes, and page formatting codes-- all with many examples of real use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many different approaches to "templating" with Perl--such as Embperl, Mason, HTML::Template, and hundreds of other lesser known systems--the Template Toolkit is widely recognized as one of the most versatile.  Like other templating systems, the Template Toolkit allows programmers to embed Perl code and custom macros into HTML documents in order to create customized documents on the fly. But unlike the others, the Template Toolkit is as facile at producing HTML as it is at producing XML, PDF, or any other output format. And because it has its own simple templating language, templates can be written and edited by people who don't know Perl. In short, the Template Toolkit combines the best features of its competitors, with ease-of-use and flexibility, resulting in a technology that's fast, powerful and extensible, and ideally suited to the production and maintenance of web content and other dynamic document systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Perl Template Toolkit&lt;/i&gt; you'll find detailed coverage of this increasingly popular technology. Written by core members of the technology's development team, the book guides you through the entire process of installing, configuring, using, and extending the Template Toolkit. It begins with a fast-paced but thorough tutorial on building web content with the Template Toolkit, and then walks you through generating and using data files, particularly with XML. It also provides detailed information on the Template Toolkit's modules, libraries, and tools in addition to a complete reference manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics in the book include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting started with the template toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Template language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Template directives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extending the Template Toolkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessing databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced static web page techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic web content and web applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The only book to cover this important tool, &lt;i&gt;Perl Template Toolkit&lt;/i&gt; is essential reading for any Perl programmer who wants to create dynamic web content that is remarkably easy to maintain. This book is your surefire guide to implementing this fast, flexible, and powerful templating system. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the applications in Microsoft Office, Word is the dominant word-processing program for both Windows and Mac users. Millions of people around the globe use it. But many, if not most, of them barely skim the surface of what is possible with Microsoft Word. Seduced by the application's supposed simplicity, they settle for just what's obvious--even if it doesn't satisfy their wants and needs. They may curse the wretched Bullets and Numbering buttons multiple times a day or take hours to change the font size of every heading in a lengthy report, yet they're reluctant to dig deeper to take advantage of Word's immense capabilities and limitless customization tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;i&gt;Word Hacks&lt;/i&gt; be your shovel. Let it carve your way into Word and make this most popular and powerful application do precisely what you want it to do. Filled with insider tips, tools, tricks, and hacks, this book will turn you into the power user you always wanted to be. Far beyond a tutorial, &lt;i&gt;Word Hacks&lt;/i&gt; assumes you have a solid working knowledge of the application and focuses on showing you exactly how to accomplish your pressing tasks, address your frequent annoyances, and solve even your most complex problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Andrew Savikas examines Word's advanced (and often hidden) features and delivers clever, time-saving hacks on taming document bloat, customization, complex search and replace, Tables of Contents and indexes, importing and exporting files, tables and comments, and even using Google as a dictionary! With him as your guide, you'll soon be understanding--and hacking--Word in ways you never thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covering Word 2000, 2002 and Word 2003, &lt;i&gt;Word Hacks&lt;/i&gt; exposes the inner workings of Word and releases your inner hacker; with it, you will be equipped to take advantage of the application s staggering array of advanced features that were once found only in page layout programs and graphics software and turning Word into your personal productivity powerhouse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Become a power user with &lt;i&gt;Word Hacks&lt;/i&gt;! Insider tips, tools, tricks, and hacks help you accomplish your pressing tasks, address your frequent annoyances, and solve even your most complex problems.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene sequence data is the most abundant type of data available, and if you're interested in analyzing it, you'll find a wealth of computational methods and tools to help you.  In fact, finding the data is not the challenge at all; rather it is dealing with the plethora of flat file formats used to process the sequence entries and trying to remember what their specific field codes mean.  If you survive by surrounding yourself with well-thumbed hard copies of readme files or remembering exactly where to look for the details when you need them, then &lt;i&gt;Sequence Analysis in a Nutshell: A Guide to Common Tools and Databases&lt;/i&gt; is for you. This book is a handy resource, as well as an invaluable reference, for anyone who needs to know about the practical aspects and mechanics of sequence analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sequence Analysis in a Nutshell: A Guide to Common Tools and Databases&lt;/i&gt;  pulls together all of the vital information about the most commonly used databases, analytical tools, and tables used in sequence analysis.  The book is partitioned into three fundamental areas to help you maximize your use of the content. The first section, "Databases" contains examples of flatfiles from key databases (GenBank, EMBL, SWISS-PROT), the definitions of the codes or fields used in each database, and the sequence feature types/terms and qualifiers for the nucleotide and protein databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second section, "Tools" provides the command line syntax for popular applications such as ReadSeq, MEME/MAST, BLAST, ClustalW, and the EMBOSS suite of analytical tools. The third section, "Appendixes" concentrates on information essential to understanding the individual components that make up a biological sequence. The tables in this section include nucleotide and protein codes, genetic codes, as well as other relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in O'Reilly's enormously popular, straightforward "Nutshell" format, this book draws together essential information for bioinformaticians in industry and academia, as well as for students.  If sequence analysis is part of your daily life, you'll want this easy-to-use book on your desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Building Wireless Community Networks</title>
    <author>Rob Flickenger</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Building Wireless Community Networks&lt;/i&gt; is about getting people online using wireless network technology.  The 802.11b standard (also known as WiFi) makes it possible to network towns, schools, neighborhoods, small business, and almost any kind of organization.  All that's required is a willingness to cooperate and share resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first edition of this book helped thousands of people engage in community networking activities.  At the time, it was impossible to predict how quickly and thoroughly WiFi would penetrate the marketplace.  Today, with WiFi-enabled computers almost as common as Ethernet, it makes even more sense to take the next step and network your community using nothing but freely available radio spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book has showed many people how to make their network available, even from the park bench, how to extend high-speed Internet access into the many areas not served by DSL and cable providers, and how to build working communities and a shared though intangible network.  All that's required to create an access point for high-speed Internet connection is a gateway or base station.  Once that is set up, any computer with a wireless card can log onto the network and share its resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Flickenger built such a network in northern California, and continues to participate in network-building efforts.  His nuts-and-bolts guide covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selecting the appropriate equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding antenna sites, and building and installing antennas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protecting your network from inappropriate access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New network monitoring tools and techniques (new)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulations affecting wireless deployment (new)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP network administration, including DNS and IP Tunneling (new)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
 His expertise, as well as his sense of humor and enthusiasm for the topic, makes &lt;i&gt;Building Wireless Community Networks&lt;/i&gt; a very useful and readable book for anyone interested in wireless connectivity. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Perl programmers know about the Perl debugger--the nifty little built-in utility that you can use to fully debug any programs that you write. Inside the interactive debugger environment, you're prompted for commands that let you examine your source code, set breakpoints, dump out function call stacks, change values of variables, and much more. It's so convenient that some programmers run it just to test out Perl constructs as they create a program. But although it's on their radar, not many Perl programmers take the time to master the debugger. That's where the &lt;i&gt;Perl Debugger Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little book provides a quick and convenient path to mastery of the Perl debugger and its commands. Written by a core member of the Perl debugger development team, it's an ideal quick reference to debugger commands, as well as a detailed tutorial on how to get started. The &lt;i&gt;Perl Debugger Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; provides complete coverage in a conveniently small package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you write code so clean you never have to look at it twice. Or perhaps you'd rather focus your energies on writing clean code, rather than learning about the debugger. But if you need to learn about the Perl debugger in a hurry, the &lt;i&gt;Perl Debugger Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is the book you'll want to have close by. And you can always keep a copy on hand to share with programmers who need it more than you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly's Pocket References have become a favorite among programmers everywhere. By providing a wealth of important details in a concise, well-organized format, these handy books deliver just what you need to complete the task at hand. When you've reached a sticking point in your work and need to get to a solution quickly, the new &lt;i&gt;Perl Debugger Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; will get you back on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the advent of Flash Communication Server MX (FCS), Macromedia believes that it's on the edge of a breakthrough in how people think about the Internet. FCS has been designed to provide web developers with the means to add polished interactive audio and video features to their sites, the sort of features that users have come to expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the process of efficiently integrating rich media into applications, web sites, and web content is a complex one, to say the least.  That's where &lt;i&gt;Programming Flash Communication Server&lt;/i&gt; factors in.  As the foremost reference on FCS, it helps readers understand how FCS can facilitate:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Video on demand
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Live webcasts
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Video chat and messaging
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shared desktop conferences
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Live auctions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interactive whiteboard presentations
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workflow collaboration
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multi-user games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Flash Communication Server&lt;/i&gt; not only explains how to use the pre-built FCS components to construct a simple application, it also explains the architecture so that developers can program custom components to make even more advanced applications. In addition, the book explains how to truly optimize performance, and talks about considerations for networked applications as well as the media issues pertaining to FCS.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Flash Communication Server&lt;/i&gt; gives developers a sorely needed leg up on this potentially intimidating technology.  It lets users develop cool web applications ranging from direct dating experiences with real-time video, to pre-recorded corporate presentations, to news services with video and audio, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, the ability to build web sites with rich interactive features--minus the complex downloads and installation hassles--is a reality.  And now, with &lt;i&gt;Programming Flash Communication Server&lt;/i&gt; from O'Reilly by your side, you can do more quickly and easily than you ever dreamed possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>The Complete FreeBSD</title>
    <author>Greg Lehey</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD is by far the most popular version of BSD&amp;#174;, the legendary operating system that has contributed a great deal to every version of Unix&amp;#174; in use today (including Mac OS&amp;#174; X). Originally a community effort by the University of California at Berkeley, FreeBSD was aimed at making Unix a little friendlier and easier to use. By the time other free operating systems came along, BSD was firmly established and very reliable. And it continues to be today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For seven years, the FreeBSD community has relied on Greg Lehey's classic, &lt;i&gt;The Complete FreeBSD&lt;/i&gt;, to guide them through its configuration and administration. The 4th edition, covering version 5 of FreeBSD, is now available through O'Reilly Community Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Complete FreeBSD&lt;/i&gt; is an eminently practical guidebook that explains not only how to get a computer up and running with the FreeBSD operating system, but also how to turn it into a highly functional and secure server that can host large numbers of users and disks, support remote access, and provide web service, mail service, and other key parts of the Internet infrastructure. The book provides in-depth information on installation and updates, back-ups, printers, RAID, various Internet services, firewalls, the graphical X Window system, and much more. Author Greg Lehey is a member of the FreeBSD core team and has been developing, documenting, and advocating for FreeBSD for nearly ten years. Whether you're an experienced Unix user or just interested in learning more about this free operating system and how you can put it to work for you, this do-it-yourself BSD documentation will provide the information you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Complete FreeBSD&lt;/i&gt; is the second release in the O'Reilly Community Press Series.  Unlike classic O'Reilly animal books, which are created to fill an information void, the Community Press titles provide convenient printed copies of documentation that is already available online. O'Reilly's role in the series is limited to providing manufacturing and distribution services rather than editorial development, so that each Community Press title reflects the editorial voice and organization of the community that has created it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The 4th edition, covering version 5 of FreeBSD, is now available through O'Reilly Community Press. It is an eminently practical guidebook that explains not only how to get a computer up and running with the FreeBSD operating system, but also how to turn it into a highly functional and secure server that can host large numbers of users and disks, support remote access, and provide web service, mail service, and other key parts of the Internet infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Jakarta Struts Pocket Reference</title>
    <author>Chuck Cavaness, Brian Keeton</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web tier frameworks have soared in popularity over the past year or so due to the increasing complexity of Java itself, and the need to get more work done with fewer resources. Developers who used to spend hours and hours writing low-level features can use a well-written framework to build the presentation tier so they start coding the "good stuff" sooner--the business logic at the core of the program.  The Jakarta Struts Framework is one of the most popular presentation frameworks for building web applications with Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSP) technologies. If you work with the Struts Framework, then you know it speeds development time. You also know that many of its features are made up of components that are used repeatedly. Having to stop to check each component's parameters and programming details can be a time waster. The answer? The &lt;i&gt;Jakarta Struts Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt;. This portable book gives you easy access to the facts you need to get your job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Jakarta Struts Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is a quick reference to all the core features of the Jakarta Struts framework.  An excellent companion to &lt;i&gt;Programming Jakarta Struts&lt;/i&gt;, the pocket reference contains detailed information on the extensive Struts tag libraries, which were described in less detail in the larger work as they were still in development at that time. This little book also provides convenient coverage of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in Action classes&lt;/li&gt;

    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ASP.NET in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is a concise, one-volume reference to everything you need to make effective use of ASP.NET.  An invaluable resource that goes beyond the published documentation to highlight little-known details, stress practical uses for particular features, and provide real-world examples that show how features can be used in a working application, &lt;i&gt;ASP.NET in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive guide for developers of both applications and web services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated for Visual Studio .NET 2003, the 2nd edition of this book includes fresh information on application and web service development, custom controls, data access, security, deployment, and error handling, new material on web application development for mobile devices, plus an overview of the class libraries. For developers who still use Microsoft's older ASP technology, this book also provides information for migrating to ASP.NET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material in &lt;i&gt;ASP.NET in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is presented in three sections:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fast-paced introduction to ASP.NET that examines topics such as building ASP.NET applications, developing web services, creating custom controls and user controls for maximum code reuse, debugging and handling errors, understanding ASP.NET security, and configuring and deploying an ASP.NET application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A detailed reference to the properties, methods, and events of the most frequently used ASP.NET classes which include the Page class and the new .NET classes, such as HttpApplicationState and HttpSessionState, which correspond to the intrinsic objects in classic ASP. Configuration settings in web.config are also documented&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Quick Reference to the types (the classes, structures, interfaces, delegates, events, and enumerations) found in web-related namespaces to the .NET Framework Class Library.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Like other books in the "In a Nutshell" series, &lt;i&gt;ASP.NET in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition, offers the facts, including critical background information, in a no-nonsense manner that users will refer to again and again. With its wealth of up-to-date information, &lt;i&gt;ASP.NET in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;  is a book that web developers will refer to again and again. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Updated for Visual Studio .NET 2003, the 2nd edition of this book includes fresh information on application and web service development, custom controls, data access, security, deployment, and error handling, new material on web application development for mobile devices, plus an overview of the class libraries. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Java Database Best Practices</title>
    <author>George Reese</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating complex Java enterprise applications, do you spend a lot of time thumbing through a myriad of books and other resources searching for what you hope will be  the API that's right for the  project at hand? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Database Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; rescues you from having to wade through books on each of the various APIs before figuring out which method to use!  This comprehensive guide introduces each of the dominant APIs (Enterprise JavaBeans, Java Data Objects, the Java Database Connectivity API (JDBC) as well as other, lesser-known options), explores the methodology and design components that use those APIs, and then offers practices most appropriate for different types and makes of databases, as well as different types of applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Database Practices&lt;/i&gt; also examines database design, from table and database architecture to normalization, and offers a number of best practices for handling these tasks as well. Learn how to move through the various forms of normalization, understand when to denormalize, and even get detailed instructions on optimizing your SQL queries to make the best use of your database structure. Through it all, this book focuses on practical application of these techniques, giving you information that can immediately be applied to your own enterprise projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise applications in today's world are about data-- whether it be information about a product to buy, a user's credit card information, or the color that a customer prefers for their auto purchases. And just as data has grown in importance, the task of accessing that data has grown in complexity. Until now, you have been left on your own to determine which model best suits your application, and how best to use your chosen API. &lt;i&gt;Java Database Practices&lt;/i&gt; is the one stop reference book to help you determine what's appropriate for your specific project at hand. Whether it's choosing between an alphabet soup of APIs and technologies--EJB, JDO, JDBC, SQL, RDBMS, OODBMS, and more on the horizon, this book is an indispensable resource you can't do without. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Unlike other books on this topic, which focus on a single way to do things, &lt;i&gt;Java Database Best Practices&lt;/i&gt; takes you through a wide variety of different ways to store and access data, enabling you to learn which "persistence model" is most appropriate for each type of application.  This unique book covers Enterprise JavaBeans, Java Data Objects, the Java Database Connectivity API (JDBC) and other, lesser-known options.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Optimizing Oracle Performance</title>
    <author>Cary Millsap, Jeff Holt</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle system performance inefficiencies often go undetected for months or even years--even under intense scrutiny--because traditional Oracle performance analysis methods and tools are fundamentally flawed. They're unreliable and inefficient.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle DBAs and developers are all too familiar with the outlay of time and resources, blown budgets, missed deadlines, and marginally effective performance fiddling that is commonplace with traditional methods of Oracle performance tuning. In this crucial book, Cary Millsap, former VP of Oracle's System Performance Group, clearly and concisely explains how to use Oracle's response time statistics to diagnose and repair performance problems. Cary also shows how "queueing theory" can be applied to response time statistics to predict the impact of upgrades and other system changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Optimizing Oracle Performance&lt;/i&gt; eliminates the time-consuming, trial-and-error guesswork inherent in most conventional approaches to tuning. You can determine exactly where a system's performance problem is, and with equal importance, where it is  not, in just a few minutes--even if the problem is several years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Optimizing Oracle Performance&lt;/i&gt; cuts a path through the complexity of current tuning methods, and streamlines an approach that focuses on optimization techniques that any DBA can use quickly and successfully to make noticeable--even dramatic--improvements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the one thing database users care most about is response time. Naturally, DBAs focus much of their time and effort towards improving response time. But it is entirely too easy to spend hundreds of hours to improve important system metrics such as hit ratios, average latencies, and wait times, only to find users are unable to perceive the difference. And an expensive hardware upgrade may not help either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be that way. Technological advances have added impact, efficiency, measurability, predictive capacity, reliability, speed, and practicality to the science of Oracle performance optimization.  &lt;i&gt;Optimizing Oracle Performance&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to slash the frustration and expense associated with unraveling the true root cause of any type of performance problem, and reliably predict future performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of this essential book will be paid back in hours saved the first time its methods are used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;LPI Linux Certification in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;,
Second Edition is an invaluable resource for determining what you need
to practice to pass the Linux Professional Institute exams. This book
will help
you determine when you're ready to take the exams, which are
technically challenging and designed to reflect the skills that
administrators need
in real working environments.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As more corporations adopt Linux as the networking backbone for their
IT systems, the demand for certified technicians will become
even greater. Passing the LPI exams will broaden your career options
because the LPIC
is the most widely known and respected Linux certification program in
the
world. &lt;i&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/i&gt; recognized the LPI as the best
Training and
Certification Program. The exams were developed by the Linux
Professional Institute,
an international, volunteer-driven organization with affiliates in a
dozen countries.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The core LPI exams cover two levels. Level 1 tests a basic knowledge of
Linux installation, configuration, and command-line
skills. Level 2 goes into much more depth regarding system
troubleshooting and
network services such as email and the Web. The second edition of &lt;i&gt;LPI
Linux
Certification in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is a thoroughly researched
reference to these exams. The book is divided into four parts, one for
each of the
LPI exams. Each part features not only a summary of the core skills you
need, but sample exercises and test questions, along with helpful hints
to let
you focus your energies.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major topics include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GNU and Unix commands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linux installation and package management&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Devices, filesystems, and kernel configuration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Text editing, processing, and printing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The X Window System&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Networking fundamentals and troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security, including intrusion detection, SSH, Kerberos, and
more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DNS, DHCP, file sharing, and other networking infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email, FTP, and Web services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Praise for the first edition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Although O'Reilly's Nutshell series are intended as 'Desktop
Reference' manuals, I have to recommend this one as a good
all-round read; not only as a primer for LPI certification, but as an
excellent introductory text on GNU/Linux. In all, this is a valuable
addition to
O'Reilly's already packed stable of Linux titles and I look forward to
more from the author."&lt;/i&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Microsoft's Office 2003, users experience the merger of the power of the classic Office suite of applications with the fluidity of data exchange inherent in XML. With XML at its heart, the new version of Microsoft's desktop suite liberates the information stored in millions of documents created with Office software over the past fifteen years, making it available to a wide variety of programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Office 2003 XML&lt;/i&gt; offers an in-depth exploration of the relationship between XML and Office 2003, examining how the various products in the Office suite both produce and consume XML.  Developers will learn how they can connect Microsoft Office to others systems, while power users will learn to create and analyze XML documents using familiar Office tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book begins with an overview of the XML features included in the various Office 2003 components, and explores in detail how Word, Excel, and Access interact with XML. This book covers both the user interface side, creating interfaces so that users can comfortably (and even unknowingly) work with XML, and the back end, exposing Office information to other processes. It also looks at Microsoft's new InfoPath application and how it fits with the rest of Office. Finally, the book's appendices introduce various XML technologies that may be useful in working with Office, including XSLT, W3C XML Schema, RELAX NG, and SOAP.
&lt;i&gt;Office 2003 XML&lt;/i&gt; provides quick and clear guidance to a anyone who needs to import or export information from Office documents into other systems. Both XML programmers and Office power will learn how to get the most from this powerful new intersection between Office 2003 and XML. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaServer Faces, or JSF, brings a component-based model to web application development that's similar to the model that's been used in standalone GUI applications for years.  The technology builds on the experience gained from Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and numerous commercial and open source web application frameworks that simplify the development process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;JavaServer Faces&lt;/i&gt;, developers learn how to use this new framework to build real-world web applications. The book contains everything you'll need: how to construct the HTML on the front end; how to create the user interface components that connect the front end to your business objects; how to write a back-end that's JSF-friendly; and how to create the deployment descriptors that tie everything together.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JavaServer Faces&lt;/i&gt; pays particular attention to simple tasks that are easily ignored, but crucial to any real application: working with tablular data, for example, or enabling and disabling buttons.  And this book doesn't hide from the trickier issues, like creating custom components or creating renderers for different presentation layers.  Whether you're experienced with JSF or a just starting out, you'll find everything you need to know about this technology in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The JSF environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating and rendering components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validating input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling user-generated events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling page navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with tabular data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internationalization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration between JSF and Struts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing custom renderers and custom components&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;JavaServer Faces&lt;/i&gt; is a complete guide to the crucial new JSF technology.  If you develop web applications, JSF belongs in your toolkit, and this book belongs in your library. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL</title>
    <author>Hugh E. Williams, David Lane</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for serving up dynamic content from a web site: to offer an online shopping site, create customized information pages for users, or just manage a large volume of content through a database. Anyone with a modest knowledge of HTML and web site management can learn to create dynamic content through the PHP programming language and the MySQL database. This book gives you the background and tools to do the job safely and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Web Database Applications with PHP and MySQL&lt;/i&gt;, Second Edition thoroughly reflects the needs of real-world applications.  It goes into detail on such practical issues as validating input (do you know what a proper credit card number looks like?), logging in users, and using templates
to give your dynamic web pages a standard look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this book goes even further. It shows how JavaScript and PHP can be used in tandem to make a user's experience faster and more pleasant. It shows the correct way to handle errors in user input so that a site looks professional. It introduces the vast collection of powerful tools available in the PEAR repository and shows how to use some of the most popular tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even while it serves as an introduction to new programmers, the book does not omit critical tasks that web sites require. For instance, every site that allows updates must handle the possibility of multiple users accessing data at the same time. This book explains how to solve the problem in detail with locking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a sophisticated sample application--Hugh and Dave's Wine Store--all the important techniques of dynamic content are introduced. Good design is emphasized, such as dividing logic from presentation. The book introduces PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1 features, while providing techniques that can be used on older versions of the software that are still in widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new edition has been redesigned around the rich offerings of PEAR. Several of these, including the Template package and the database-independent query API, are fully integrated into examples and thoroughly described in the text. Topics include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installation and configuration of Apache, MySQL, and PHP on Unix&amp;#174;, Windows&amp;#174;, and Mac OS&amp;#174; X systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introductions to PHP, SQL, and MySQL administration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session management, including the use of a custom database for improved efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User input validation, security, and authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PEAR repository, plus details on the use of PEAR DB and Template classes&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to network security, many users and administrators are running scared, and justifiably so.  The sophistication of attacks against computer systems increases with each new Internet worm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the worst an attacker can do to you?  You'd better find out, right?  That's what &lt;i&gt;Security Warrior&lt;/i&gt; teaches you.  Based on the principle that the only way to defend yourself is to understand your attacker in depth, &lt;i&gt;Security Warrior&lt;/i&gt; reveals how your systems can be attacked.  Covering everything from reverse engineering to SQL attacks, and including topics like social engineering, antiforensics, and common attacks against UNIX and Windows systems, this book teaches you to know your enemy and how to be prepared to do battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Security Warrior&lt;/i&gt; places particular emphasis on reverse engineering.  RE is a fundamental skill for the administrator, who must be aware of all kinds of malware that can be installed on his machines -- trojaned binaries, "spyware" that looks innocuous but that sends private data back to its creator, and more.  This is the only book to discuss reverse engineering for Linux or Windows CE.  It's also the only book that shows you how SQL injection works, enabling you to inspect your database and web applications for vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Security Warrior&lt;/i&gt; is the most comprehensive and up-to-date book covering the art of computer war: attacks against computer systems and their defenses.  It's often scary, and never comforting.  If you're on the front lines, defending your site against attackers, you need this book.  On your shelf--and in your hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samba is a cross-platform triumph: it turns a Unix or Linux system into a file and print server for Microsoft Windows network clients.This book describes all the options for Samba's configuration file in quick-reference format. It also contains command-line options and related information on the use of the Samba daemons (smbd, nmbd, and winbindd) and the utilities in the Samba distribution.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The current edition covers Samba 2.x and the most important features of 3.0, which was under development as this book went to print. New options pertain to Samba's acting as a primary domain controller and as a domain member server, its support for the use of Windows NT/2000/XP authentication and filesystem security on the host Unix system, and access to shared files and printers from Unix clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
System administrators who are familiar with Samba and want a handy reminder of how to administer it without the bulk of a full-sized book will find this pocket reference invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Packaged Composite Applications</title>
    <author>Dan Woods</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's corporate computing environment is too often characterized by silos of data in enterprise applications like ERP, CRM, and supply chain management.  Integrating these applications involves hardwiring connections between them, often resulting in a rigid and inefficient IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packaged Composite Applications (PCAs) are an innovative answer to this dysfunctional scenario.  Originated by SAP, one of the worlds foremost technology companies, PCAs represent a new architectural paradigm for enterprise computing.  Using web services, they combine new functionality with services from existing applications to enable flexible, cross-functional automation.  But is this new model right for your business?  That's where this book comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Packaged Composite Applications&lt;/i&gt; is the result of a systematic search through the brain trust of SAP for all of the relevant arguments, examples, concepts, and analogies related to Packaged Composite Applications. This book is not a marketing treatise about neatly-shaped colored boxes. It is not a backward-looking, outdated description of a product without context. This book, rather, combines the approach of a forward-looking analyst with the perspective of an executive who must make things work, without skimping on the relevant technical details. The author examines the ideas driving PCAs forward in the marketplace and the problems and solutions that an executive and technologist will encounter in implementation.  The result is an authoritative text that allows all interested parties to assess the value of PCAs for their lives as executives, technologists, analysts, sales representatives, and users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>TiVo Hacks</title>
    <author>Raffi Krikorian</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TiVo Hacks&lt;/i&gt; helps you get the most out of your TiVo personal video recorder. Armed with just a screwdriver and basic understanding of PC hardware (or willingness to learn), preeminent hackability awaits. This book includes hacks for changing the order of recorded programs, activating the 30-second skip to blaze through commercials, upgrading TiVo's hard drive for more hours of recording, use of TiVo's Home Media Option to remotely schedule a recording via the Web, log in to the serial port for command-line access to programming data, log files, closed-captioning data, display graphics on the TiVo screen, and even play MP3s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers who use advanced hacks to put TiVo on their home network via the serial port, Ethernet, USB, or wireless (with 802.11b WiFi) will watch a whole new world open up. By installing various open source software packages, you can use TiVo for mail, instant messaging, caller-ID, and more. It's also easy to run a web server on TiVo to schedule recordings, access lists of recorded shows, and even display them on a web site. While TiVo gives viewers personalized control of their TVs, &lt;i&gt;TiVo Hacks&lt;/i&gt; gives users personalized control of TiVo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Not all TiVos are the same. The original TiVo, the Series 1, is the most hackable TiVo out there; it's a box thrown together with commodity parts and the TiVo code is running on open hardware. The Series 2 TiVo, the most commonly sold TiVo today, is not open. You won't see hacks in this book that involve modifying Series 2 software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;TiVo Hacks&lt;/i&gt; covers tips for changing the order of recorded programs, activating the 30-second skip to blaze through commercials, and more, by using magical remote-control codes.  Once you take the lid off, you will learn how to gain even more fun and functionality. You can upgrade the hard drive for more hours of recording, log in to the serial port for command-line access to programming data, log files, closed-captioning data, display graphics on the TiVo screen, and even play MP3s. &lt;/p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in 3D visualization and physics-based simulation technology make it possible for game developers to create compelling, visually immersive gaming environments that were only dreamed of years ago. But today's game players have grown in sophistication along with the games they play. It's no longer enough to wow your players with dazzling graphics; the next step in creating even more immersive games is improved artificial intelligence, or AI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, advanced AI game techniques are within the grasp of every game developer--not just those who dedicate their careers to AI. If you're new to game programming or if you're an experienced game programmer who needs to get up to speed quickly on AI techniques, you'll find &lt;i&gt;AI for Game Developers&lt;/i&gt; to be the perfect starting point for understanding and applying AI techniques to your games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written for the novice AI programmer, &lt;i&gt;AI for Game Developers&lt;/i&gt; introduces you to techniques such as finite state machines, fuzzy logic, neural networks, and many others, in straightforward, easy-to-understand language, supported with code samples throughout the entire book (written in C/C++). From basic techniques such as chasing and evading, pattern movement, and flocking to genetic algorithms, the book presents a mix of deterministic (traditional) and non-deterministic (newer) AI techniques aimed squarely at beginners AI developers. Other topics covered in the book include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potential function based movements: a technique that handles chasing, evading swarming, and collision avoidance simultaneously&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic pathfinding and waypoints, including an entire chapter devoted to the A* pathfinding algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI scripting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rule-based AI: learn about variants other than fuzzy logic and finite state machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic probability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bayesian techniques&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Unlike other books on the subject, &lt;i&gt;AI for Game Developers&lt;/i&gt; doesn't attempt to cover every aspect of game AI, but to provide you with usable, advanced techniques you can apply to your games right now.  If you've wanted to use AI to extend the play-life of your games, make them more challenging, and most importantly, make them more fun, then this book is for you. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>STL Pocket Reference</title>
    <author>Ray Lischner</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;STL Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; describes the functions, classes, and templates in that part of the C++ standard library often referred to as the Standard Template Library (STL). The STL encompasses containers, iterators, algorithms, and function objects, which collectively represent one of the most important and widely used subsets of standard library functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C++ standard library, even the subset known as the STL, is vast. It's next to impossible to work with the STL without some sort of reference at your side to remind you of template parameters, function invocations, return types--indeed, the entire myriad of details you need to know in order to use the STL effectively and get work done. You need a memory-aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books that cover the standard library and the STL tend to be quite heavy and large, describing each aspect of the STL in detail. Such books are great when you're not familiar with the library, but get in the way when you simply need to remind yourself of a function name, or the order in which you pass arguments to a function. Programmers familiar with the STL need a small, lightweight memory-aid. That's what the &lt;i&gt;STL Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is. It's small, lightweight, and chock-full of information that you can take in at a glance, so you can get on with your work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of computers around the world today are connected by the Internet, so why is it still so hard to hook up a few PCs in you own home? Whether you want to share an Internet connection, install WiFi, or maybe just cut down on the number of printers you own, home networks are supposed to help make your life easier. Instead, most aspiring home networkers get lost in a confusing maze of terms and technologies: 802.11g, Fast Ethernet, Cat 5 cable (or was it Cat 5e?), Powerline, and on and confusingly on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where &lt;i&gt;Home Networking: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; comes in. Using clear language, straightforward explanations, and a dash of humor, this book shows you how to do everything you need to set up a home network. Coverage includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WiFi, Ethernet, or Powerline? There are several kinds of digital pipes that you can use to create your network, and none of them have friendly names. This book tells you what they are, explains the pros and cons of each, and helps you figure out what you need to buy, and how to install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows and Mac info included. Half the battle in home networking takes place after you've bought your gear and plugged it in. That's because the routers, network adapters, and cables that you need get you only part way towards networking nirvana. Whether you've got PCs or Macs or both, you'll need help tweaking your computers' settings if you want to get all your machines talking to each other. This book covers most known operating system flavors, including Windows XP, 2000, Me, and 98, and Mac OS X and OS 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun things to do with your network. The real fun starts once your network is up and  running. This book shows you how to do much more than simply share an Internet connection and a printer. You'll learn how to stream music from your PCs to your stereo, how to display pictures on your TV, how to hook up game consoles to your network, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important, this book helps you understand the difference between what you need to know to create and use your home network and what's best left to those looking for a career as a system administrator. In &lt;i&gt;Home Networking: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; you'll find everything you need to get your network running-and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While computers and other devices identify each other on networks or the Internet by using unique addresses made up of numbers, humans rely on the Domain Name System (DNS), the distributed database that allows us to identify machines by name.  DNS does the work of translating domain names into numerical IP addresses, routing mail to its proper destination, and many other services, so that users require little or no knowledge of the system. If you're a network or system administrator, however, configuring, implementing, and maintaining DNS zones can be a formidable challenge. And now, with Windows Server 2003, an understanding of the workings of DNS is even more critical.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;DNS on Windows Server 20003&lt;/i&gt; is a special Windows-oriented edition of the classic &lt;i&gt;DNS and BIND&lt;/i&gt;, updated to document the many changes to DNS, large and small, found in Windows Server 2003.  Veteran O'Reilly authors, Cricket Liu, Matt Larson, and Robbie Allen explain the whole system in terms of the new Windows Server 2003, from starting and stopping a DNS service to establishing an organization's namespace in the global hierarchy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Besides covering general issues like installing, setting up, and maintaining the server, &lt;i&gt;DNS on Windows Server 2003&lt;/i&gt; tackles the many issues specific to the new Windows environment, including the use of the dnscmd program to manage the Microsoft DNS Server from the command line and development using the WMI DNS provider to manage the name server programmatically. The book also documents new features of the Microsoft DNS Server in Windows Server 2003, including conditional forwarding and zone storage in Active Directory (AD) application partitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;DNS on Windows Server 2003&lt;/i&gt; provides grounding in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System tuning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zone change notification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning for growth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If you're a Windows administrator, &lt;i&gt;DNS on Windows Server 2003&lt;/i&gt; is the operations manual you need for working with DNS every day. If you're a Windows user who simply wants to take the mystery out of the Internet, this book is a readable introduction to the Internet's architecture and inner workings.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>JavaServer Pages</title>
    <author>Hans Bergsten</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaServer Pages (JSP) has built a huge following since the release of JSP 1.0 in 1999, providing Enterprise Java developers with a flexible tool for the development of dynamic web sites and web applications. While new point releases over the years, along with the introduction of the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL), have incrementally improved the rough areas of the first version of the JSP specification, JSP 2.0 takes this technology to new heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JavaServer Pages&lt;/i&gt;, Third Edition, is completely revised and updated to cover the JSP 2.0 and JSTL 1.1 specifications. It includes detailed coverage of the Expression Language (EL) incorporated into JSP 2.0, the JSTL 1.1 tag libraries and the new function library, the new tag file format that enables custom tag library development without Java code, the simplified Java tag library API, improvements in the JSP XML syntax, and more. Further, it details setup of the Apache Tomcat server, JSP and JSTL syntax and features, error handling and debugging, authentication and personalization, database access, XML processing, and internationalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book recognizes the different needs of the two groups of professionals who want to learn JSP: page authors interested in using JSP elements in web pages, and programmers concerned with learning the JSP API and using JSP effectively as a part of an enterprise application. If you're in the first group, you'll learn from the practical web application examples in the second part of the book. If you're in the latter group, you'll appreciate the detailed coverage of advanced topics in the third part, such as how to integrate servlets and JavaBeans components with JSP using the popular Apache Struts MVC framework, and how to develop custom tag libraries using the JSP API, with realistic examples that you can use as a springboard for your own libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hans Bergsten, a JSP expert group veteran and one of our most active contributors, has thoroughly and accurately captured the new features of JSP 2.0 and JSTL 1.1 in a way that is well-organized and easy to understand. With excellent, to-the-point examples, this book is a 'must have' for any serious JSP 2.0 developer."
--Mark Roth, JSP 2.0 Specification Lead, Sun Microsystems, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hans Bergsten is the founder of Gefion Software, a company focused on Java services and products based on J2EE technologies. Hans has been an active participant in the working groups for both the servlet and JSP specifications since their inception and contributes to other related JCP specifications, such as JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) and JavaServer Faces (JSF), and, as one of the initial members of the Apache Jakarta Project Management Committee, helped develop the Apache Tomcat reference implementation for the servlet and JSP specifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JavaServer Pages&lt;/i&gt;, Third Edition is completely revised and updated to cover the substantial changes in the 2.0 version of the JSP specification. It also includes detailed coverage of the major revisions to the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) specification. Combining plenty of practical advice with detailed coverage of JSP syntax and features and clear, useful examples, &lt;i&gt;JavaServer Pages&lt;/i&gt;, Third Edition demonstrates how to embed server-side Java into Web pages, while also covering important topics such as JavaBeans, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and JDBC database access. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to thoroughly understand what makes Linux tick and why it works so well on a wide variety of systems, you need to delve deep into the heart of the kernel. The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, in what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can share the system efficiently, and expertly organizes data transfers so that the CPU isn't kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow disks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The third edition of &lt;i&gt;Understanding the Linux Kernel&lt;/i&gt; takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine.  Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This edition of the book covers Version 2.6, which has seen significant changes to nearly every kernel subsystem, particularly in the areas of memory management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended Filesystems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process creation and scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synchronization within the kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interprocess Communication (IPC) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program execution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Understanding the Linux Kernel&lt;/i&gt; will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but it's more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. This book will help you make the most of your Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>CVS Pocket Reference</title>
    <author>Gregor N. Purdy</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of open source is making code freely available. The curse is trying to organize the chaos that code development can evolve into. CVS, the Concurrent Version System, is an open source tool for managing and distributing source code. It allows multiple users dispersed over a wide geographic area to work on the same file at the same time, using a shared directory. Under CVS, multiple users can check out files from a directory tree, make changes, and then commit those changes back into the directory. CVS is a pivotal tool on many projects involving information or software, whether in-house or conducted over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;CVS Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is a quick reference guide to help administrators and users set up and manage source code development. This small book delivers the core concepts of version control along with a complete command reference and guide to configuration and repository set up. The book includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A version control primer that teaches the general concepts of version control and how it applies to CVS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructions on how to install and configure CVS for Unix&amp;#174;-like operating systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrator and user sections, with complete listings of their respective commands and options for configuring and using CVS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Details on how to import files from RCS and SCCS directories into CVS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;References to related useful materials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Much more than a quick list of commands and options, this little book is packed with a surprising amount of detail--including an overview of background concepts, thorough descriptions on how to use and administer a CVS repository, and discussions of CVS-related files and how to manage them--all in a convenient reference format. This edition covers the CVS 1.11 and includes new commands for querying a central CVS repository, new configuration parameters, and new options for setting up a server for remote access. The book is a perfect companion for open source developers. The &lt;i&gt;CVS Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; also contains tips on common tasks, such as converting projects from other revision control formats to CVS. It's an absolute must for developers who need an on-the-job guide for quick answers to CVS dilemmas.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Hardcore Java</title>
    <author>Robert Simmons Jr</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java has quickly become one of the most important languages in programming, particularly for professional and enterprise-level projects. From its infancy as a language primarily used for web applets to its maturity through servlets, Enterprise JavaBeans, and database access, Java has become a complex and robust tool for today's developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hardcore Java&lt;/i&gt; takes this language and breaks it apart, piece by piece, revealing the important secrets and tricks that will take you from a junior-level programmer to a seasoned and expert developer. You'll fly through the fundamentals and quickly find yourself learning about advanced memory management techniques, optimization and bytecode-level enhancements, and the techniques required to build lightning-fast GUIs. Throughout the book, you'll also master the art of writing and maintaining bulletproof and error-proof code, all while grasping the intricacies of the Java language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hardcore Java&lt;/i&gt; covers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use of the final keyword to optimize and protect your Java classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete and thorough coverage of all types of nested classes, including how to optimize anonymous and inner classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed discussion of immutable objects, including unique tips on when to use them (and when not to).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elimination of bugs through exception-handling management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-depth studies of constants, including their impact on the Java memory model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most thorough discussion of reflection in print, moving far beyond other books' "Hello World" coverage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction and use of dynamic proxies, in both Java Standard and Enterprise editions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expansive coverage of weak references, including usage patterns and their role in garbage collection and memory management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hardcore Java&lt;/i&gt; is an invaluable addition to every programmer's library, and even the most advanced developers will find themselves moving beyond their own conceptions into truly advanced applications of the language. Thousands of lines of code, heavily commented and easily runnable, illustrate each concept in the book. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firewalls, Network Address Translation (NAT), network logging and accounting are all provided by Linux's Netfilter system, also known by the name of the command used to administer it, &lt;em&gt;iptables&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;iptables&lt;/em&gt; interface is the most sophisticated ever offered on
Linux and makes Linux an extremely flexible system for any kind of network filtering you might do. Large sets of filtering rules can be grouped in ways that makes it easy to test them and turn them on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you watch for all types of ICMP traffic--some of them quite dangerous? Can you take advantage of stateful filtering to simplify the management of TCP connections? Would you like to track how much traffic of various types you get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pocket reference will help you at those critical moments when someone asks you to open or close a port in a hurry, either to enable some important traffic or to block an attack. The book will keep the subtle syntax straight and help you remember all the values you have to enter in order to be as secure as possible. The book has an introductory section that describes applications,followed by a reference/encyclopaedic section with all the matches and targets arranged alphabetically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Linux iptables Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; organizes the subtle netfilter syntax for quick and easy lookup, and helps administrators remember all the values they need to enter to assure strict security. The book divides the listings of all iptables options into those that are suitable for firewalling, accounting, and Network Address Translation (NAT). Our unique quick reference format is ideal for Linux administrators who already have a firewall in place, but need to be prepared for frequent changes in their environment. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the outside world, a "supercomputer" appears to be a single system. In fact, it's a cluster of computers that share a local area network and have the ability to work together on a single problem as a team. Many businesses used to consider supercomputing beyond the reach of their budgets, but new Linux applications have made high-performance clusters more affordable than ever. These days, the promise of low-cost supercomputing is one of the main reasons many businesses choose Linux over other operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new guide covers everything a newcomer to clustering will need to plan, build, and deploy a high-performance Linux cluster. The book focuses on clustering for high-performance computation, although much of its information also applies to clustering for high-availability (failover and disaster recovery). The book discusses the key tools you'll need to get started, including good practices to use while exploring the tools and growing a system. You'll learn about planning, hardware choices, bulk installation of Linux on multiple systems, and other basic considerations. Then, you'll learn about software options that can save you hours--or even weeks--of deployment time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a wide variety of options exist in each area of clustering software, the author discusses the pros and cons of the major free software projects and chooses those that are most likely to be helpful to new cluster administrators and programmers. A few of the projects introduced in the book include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MPI, the most popular programming library for clusters. This book offers simple but realistic introductory examples along with some pointers for advanced use.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OSCAR and Rocks, two comprehensive installation and administrative systems
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;openMosix (a convenient tool for distributing jobs), Linux kernel extensions that migrate processes transparently for load balancing
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PVFS, one of the parallel filesystems that make clustering I/O easier
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;C3, a set of commands for administering multiple systems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Ganglia, OpenPBS, and cloning tools (Kickstart, SIS and G4U) are also covered. The book looks at cluster installation packages (OSCAR &amp;amp; Rocks) and then considers the core packages individually for greater depth or for folks wishing to do a custom installation.  Guidelines for debugging, profiling, performance tuning, and managing jobs from multiple users round out this immensely useful book. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do Ford Financial, IBM, and Victoria's Secret have in common? Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB).  As the industry standard for platform-independent reusable business components, EJB has just become Sun Microsystem's latest developer certification. Whether you want to be certifiable or just want to learn the technology inside and out, &lt;i&gt;Head First EJB&lt;/i&gt; will get you there in the least painful way. And with the greatest understanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll learn not just what the technology &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, but more importantly, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it is, and what it is and isn't good for. You'll learn tricks and tips for EJB development, along with tricks and tips for passing this latest, very challenging Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD) exam. You'll learn how to think like a server. You'll learn how to think like a bean. And because this is a Head First book, you'll learn how to think about thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author Kathy Sierra was one of Sun's first employees to teach brave, early adopter customers how to use EJB. She has the scars. But besides dragging you deep into EJB technology, Kathy and Bert will see you through your certification exam, if you decide to go for it. And nobody knows the certification like they do - they're co-developers of Sun's actual exam!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the second book in the Head First series, &lt;i&gt;Head First EJB&lt;/i&gt; follows up the number one best-selling Java book in the US, &lt;i&gt;Head First Java&lt;/i&gt;. Find out why reviewers are calling it a revolution in learning tough technical topics, and why Sun Chairman and CEO Scott McNealy says, "Java technology is everywhere...if you develop software and haven't learned Java, it's definitely time to dive in "Head First."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with Head First book, you don't even have to feel guilty about having fun while you're learning; it's all part of the learning theory. If the latest research in cognitive science, education, and neurobiology suggested that boring, dry, and excruciatingly painful was the best way to learn, we'd have done it. Thankfully, it's been shown that your brain has a sense of style, a sense of humour, and a darn good sense of what it likes and dislikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Head First EJB&lt;/i&gt;, you'll learn all about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Component-based and role-based development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The architecture of EJB, distributed programming with RMI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing and Deploying an EJB application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Client View of a Session and Entity bean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Session Bean Lifecycle and Component Contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Entity bean Lifecycle and Component Contract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container-managed Persistence (CMP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container-managed Relationships (CMR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EJB-QL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EJB Exceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Deployment Descriptor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Enterprise Bean Environment in JNDI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming Restrictions and Portability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The book includes over 200 mock exam questions that match the tone, style, difficulty, and topics on the real SCBCD exam. See why Kathy and Bert are responsible for thousands of successful exam-passers--
&lt;p&gt;"The Sun certification exam was certainly no walk in the park, but Kathy's material allowed me to not only pass the exam, but Ace it!"
--Mary Whetsel, Sr. Technology Specialist, Application Strategy and Integration, The St. Paul Companies&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates are two of the few people in the world who can make complicated things seem damn simple, and as if that isn't enough, they can make boring things seem interesting."

&lt;p&gt;"Who better to write a Java study guide than Kathy Sierra, reigning queen of Java instruction? Kathy Sierra has done it again.  Here is a study guide that almost guarantees you a certification!"
--James Cubetta, Systems Engineer, SGI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Head First EJB&lt;/i&gt;, you'll learn not just what the technology &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, but more importantly, &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it is, and what it is and isn't good for. You'll learn tricks and tips for EJB development, along with tricks and tips for passing this latest, very challenging Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD) exam. You'll learn how to think like a server. You'll learn how to think like a bean. And because this is a Head First book, you'll learn how to think about thinking... And nobody knows the certification like they do --they're co-developers of Sun's actual exam!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With literally hundreds of examples and thousands of lines of code, the &lt;i&gt;Java Servlet and JSP Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; yields tips and techniques that any Java web developer who uses JavaServer Pages or servlets will use every day, along with full-fledged solutions to significant web application development problems that developers can insert directly into their own applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Servlet and JSP Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; presents real-world problems, and provides concise, practical solutions to each. Finding even one tested code "recipe" that solves a gnarly problem in this comprehensive collection of solutions and best practices will save hours of frustration--easily justifying the cost of this invaluable book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But "Java Servlet and JSP Cookbook" is more than just a wealth of cut-and-paste code. It also offers clear explanations of how and why the code works, warns of potential pitfalls, and directs you to sources of additional information, so you can learn to adapt the problem-solving techniques to similar situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These recipes include vital topics like the use of Ant to setup a build environment, extensive coverage of the WAR file format and web.xml deployment descriptor, file-uploading, error-handling, cookies, logging, dealing with non-HTML content, multimedia, request filtering, web services, I18N, web services, and  a host of other topics that frustrate even the most seasoned developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Java web developers of all levels who are eager to put into practice the theory presented in other API-focused books, the solutions presented in this practical book will prove invaluable over and over again. This is painless way for less experienced developers who prefer to learn by doing to expand their skills and productivity, while accomplishing practical solutions to the pressing problems they face every day.  More experienced developers can use these recipes to solve time-consuming problems quickly, freeing up their time for the more creative aspects of their work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>SQL Tuning</title>
    <author>Dan Tow</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poorly performing database application not only costs users time, but also has an impact on other applications running on the same computer or the same network. &lt;i&gt;SQL Tuning&lt;/i&gt; provides an essential next step for SQL developers and database administrators who want to extend their SQL tuning expertise and get the most from their database applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two basic issues to focus on when tuning SQL: how to find and interpret the execution plan of an SQL statement and how to change SQL to get a specific alternate execution plan.  &lt;i&gt;SQL Tuning&lt;/i&gt; provides answers to these questions and addresses a third issue that's even more important: how to find the optimal execution plan for the query to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Dan Tow outlines a timesaving method he's developed for finding the optimum execution plan--rapidly and systematically--regardless of the complexity of the SQL or the database platform being used. You'll learn how to understand and control SQL execution plans and how to diagram SQL queries to deduce the best execution plan for a query. Key chapters in the book include exercises to reinforce the concepts you've learned. &lt;i&gt;SQL Tuning&lt;/i&gt; concludes by addressing special concerns and unique solutions to "unsolvable problems." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a programmer who develops SQL-based applications or a database administrator or other who troubleshoots poorly tuned applications, &lt;i&gt;SQL Tuning&lt;/i&gt; will arm you with a reliable and deterministic method for tuning your SQL queries to gain optimal performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Spidering Hacks</title>
    <author>Morbus Iff, Tara Calishain</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet, with its profusion of information, has made us hungry for ever more, ever better data. Out of necessity, many of us have become pretty adept with search engine queries, but there are times when even the most powerful search engines aren't enough. If you've ever wanted your data in a different form than it's presented, or wanted to collect data from several sites and see it side-by-side without the constraints of a browser, then &lt;i&gt;Spidering Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spidering Hacks&lt;/i&gt; takes you to the next level in Internet data retrieval--beyond search engines--by showing you how to create spiders and bots to retrieve information from your favorite sites and data sources. You'll no longer feel constrained by the way host sites think you want to see their data presented--you'll learn how to scrape and repurpose raw data so you can view in a way that's meaningful to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written for developers, researchers, technical assistants, librarians, and power users, &lt;i&gt;Spidering Hacks&lt;/i&gt; provides expert tips on spidering and scraping methodologies. You'll begin with a crash course in spidering concepts, tools (Perl, LWP, out-of-the-box utilities), and ethics (how to know when you've gone too far: what's acceptable and unacceptable). Next, you'll collect media files and data from databases. Then you'll learn how to interpret and understand the data, repurpose it for use in other applications, and even build authorized interfaces to integrate the data into your own content.  By the time you finish &lt;i&gt;Spidering Hacks&lt;/i&gt;, you'll be able to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aggregate and associate data from disparate locations, then store and manipulate the data as you like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain a competitive edge in business by knowing when competitors' products are on sale, and comparing sales ranks and product placement on e-commerce sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate third-party data into your own applications or web sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your own site easier to scrape and more usable to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep up-to-date with your favorite comics strips, news stories, stock tips, and more without visiting the site every day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Like the other books in O'Reilly's popular Hacks series, &lt;i&gt;Spidering Hacks&lt;/i&gt; brings you 100 industrial-strength tips and tools from the experts to help you master this technology.  If you're interested in data retrieval of any type, this book provides a wealth of data for finding a wealth of data. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing</title>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've held back from developing open source or free software projects because you don't understand the implications of the various licenses, you're not alone. Many developers believe in releasing their software freely, but have hesitated to do so because they're concerned about losing control over their software. Licensing issues are complicated, and both the facts and fallacies you hear word-of-mouth can add to the confusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing&lt;/i&gt; helps you make sense of the different options available to you. This concise guide focuses on annotated licenses, offering an in-depth explanation of how they compare and interoperate, and how license choices affect project possibilities. Written in clear language that you don't have to be a lawyer to understand, the book answers such questions as: What rights am I giving up? How will my use of OS/FS licensing affect future users or future developers? Does a particular use of this software--such as combining it with proprietary software--leave me vulnerable to lawsuits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a quick look at copyright law, contracts, and the definition of "open source," the book tackles the spectrum of licensing, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The MIT (or X), BSD, Apache and Academic Free licenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GPL, LGPL, and Mozilla licenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The QT, Artistic, and Creative Commons licenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classic Proprietary licenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sun Community Source license and Microsoft Shared Source project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The book wraps up with a look at the legal effects--both positive and negative--of open source/free software licensing.
&lt;p&gt;Licensing is a major part of what open source and free software are all about, but it's still one of the most complicated areas of law. Even the very simple licenses are tricky. &lt;i&gt;Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing&lt;/i&gt; bridges the gap between the open source vision and the practical implications of its legal underpinnings. If open source and free software licenses interest you, this book will help you understand them. If you're an open source/free software developer, this book is an absolute necessity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PL/SQL, Oracle's powerful procedural language, has been the cornerstone of Oracle application development for nearly 15 years. Although primarily a tool for developers, PL/SQL has also become an essential tool for database administration, as DBAs take increasing responsibility for site performance and as the lines between developers and DBAs blur.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Until now, there has not been a book focused squarely on the language topics of special concern to DBAs &lt;i&gt;Oracle PL/SQL for DBAs&lt;/i&gt; fills the gap. Covering the latest Oracle version, Oracle Database 10g Release 2 and packed with code and usage examples, it contains:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A quick tour of the PL/SQL language, providing enough basic information about language fundamentals to get DBAs up and running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive coverage of security topics for DBAs: Encryption (including both traditional methods and Oracle's new Transparent Data Encryption, TDE); Row-Level Security
(RLS), Fine-Grained Auditing (FGA); and random value generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods for DBAs to improve query and database performance with cursors and table functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coverage of Oracle scheduling, which allows jobs such as database monitoring and
statistics gathering to be scheduled for regular execution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Using Oracle's built-in packages (DBMS_CRYPTO, DBMS_RLS, DBMS_FGA, DBMS_RANDOM,
DBMS_SCHEDULING) as a base, the book describes ways of building on top of these packages to suit particular organizational needs. Authors are Arup Nanda, &lt;i&gt;Oracle Magazine 2003&lt;/i&gt;  DBA of the Year, and Steven Feuerstein, the world's foremost PL/SQL expert and coauthor of the classic reference, &lt;i&gt;Oracle PL/SQL Programming&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
DBAs who have not yet discovered how helpful PL/SQL can be will find this book a superb introduction to the language and its special database administration features. Even if you have used PL/SQL for years, you'll find the detailed coverage in this book to be an invaluable resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GNU/Linux&amp;#174;  success story is well known. Firmly established as a high-performance operating system, its worldwide installations are increasing at phenomenal rates. Much of this success has been on the server side, but more and more PC users are turning to Linux on the desktop, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those grounded in Microsoft Windows&amp;#174; or Apple Macintosh&amp;#174; graphical interfaces, the first look at a powerful Unix-style operating system can be daunting. This book provides a clear, no-nonsense introduction to the popular Red Hat&amp;#174; distribution of Linux. It takes you through installation and shows you the key parts of the system, always with an eye toward what can go wrong and what you need to know to get over the humps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is known as a secure environment and a good platform to run a web server. These topics are among the many covered in this book. But did you know you can also burn CDs, sync a PalmPilot&amp;#8482;, and edit slideshow presentations with powerful tools on Linux? Those topics are covered here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat currently provides two distributions, both documented in this book. The first is their commercial, subscription-based product, called Red Hat Enterprise Linux and also available through retail channels as Red Hat Professional Workstation. The second is the freely distributed Fedora distribution. The Publisher's Edition of Fedora is included in this book on two disks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New in this edition are installation instructions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, package updating for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, information on the GRUB bootloader, and the CUPS printer system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora&lt;/i&gt; tells you how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prepare your system for installing Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install and configure Linux and the two popular desktop environments, GNOME and KDE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the most popular productivity tools on Linux: mailers, web browsers, OpenOffice, and Evolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtain and set up software through the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a Linux system for networking, either on your local area network (LAN), or via a dialup connection to the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the system-administration tools included with Red Hat, GNOME, and KDE, including such valuable utilities as Samba file-sharing and the Apache web server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand and write shell scripts so you can peek under  the hood and extend the power of Linux.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;New in this edition are installation instructions and help with package updating for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora. Information on the GRUB bootloader, and the CUPS printer system, as well as the Publisher's Edition of Fedora are also included. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Oracle Regular Expressions Pocket Reference</title>
    <author>Jonathan Gennick, Peter Linsley</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for regular expressions in SQL and PL/SQL is one of the most exciting features of Oracle Database 10G.  Oracle has long supported the ANSI-standard LIKE predicate for rudimentary pattern matching, but regular expressions take pattern matching to a new level. They provide a powerful way to select data that matches a pattern, as well as to manipulate, rearrange, and change that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concise pocket guide is part tutorial and part quick-reference. It's suitable for those who have never used regular expressions before, as well as those who have experience with Perl and other languages supporting regular expressions. The book describes Oracle Database 10G's support for regular expressions, including globalization support and differences between Perl's syntax and the POSIX syntax supported by Oracle 10G. It also provides a comprehensive reference, including examples, to all supported regular expression operators, functions, and error messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly's Pocket References have become a favorite among developers and database administrators everywhere.  By providing a wealth of important details in a concise, well-organized format, these handy books deliver just what you need to complete the task at hand. Whether you're using regular expressions for the first time or applying your skills from other languages to the latest version of Oracle, the &lt;i&gt;Oracle Regular Expressions Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is the book to have close by. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after its launch, Ant succeeded in taking the Java world by storm, becoming the most widely used tool for building applications in Java environments. Like most popular technologies, Ant quickly went through a series of early revision cycles.  With each new version, more functionality was added, and more complexity was introduced. Ant evolved from a simple-to-learn build tool into a full-fledged testing and deployment environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ant: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; has been reworked, revised and expanded upon to reflect this evolution.  It documents the new ways that Ant is being applied, as well as the array of optional tasks that Ant supports.  In fact, this new second edition covers everything about this extraordinary  build management  tool from downloading and installing, to using Ant to test code.  Here are just of a few of the features you'll find detailed in this comprehensive, must-have guide:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developing conditional builds, and handling error conditions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automatically retrieving source code from version control systems
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Ant with XML files
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Ant with JavaServer Pages to build Web applications
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Ant with Enterprise JavaBeans to build enterprise applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Far exceeding its predecessor in terms of information and detail, &lt;i&gt;Ant: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition is a must-have for Java developers unfamiliar with the latest advancements in Ant technology.  With this book at your side, you'll soon be up to speed on the premiere tool for cross-platform development.
&lt;p&gt;Author Steve Holzner is an award-winning author who s been writing about Java topics since the language first appeared; his books have sold more than 1.5 million copies worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Managing Projects with GNU Make</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The utility simply known as &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most enduring features of both Unix and other operating systems. First invented in the 1970s, &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; still turns up to this day as the central engine in most programming projects; it even builds the Linux kernel. In the third edition of the classic &lt;i&gt;Managing Projects with GNU make&lt;/i&gt;, readers will learn why this utility continues to hold its top position in project build software, despite many younger competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise behind &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; is simple: after you change source files and want to rebuild your program or other output files, &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; checks timestamps to see what has changed and rebuilds just what you need, without wasting time rebuilding other files. But on top of this simple principle, &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; layers a rich collection of options that lets you manipulate multiple directories, build different versions of programs for different platforms, and customize your builds in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This edition focuses on the GNU version of &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt;, which has deservedly become the industry standard. GNU make contains powerful extensions that are explored in this book. It is also popular because it is free software and provides a version for almost every platform, including a version for Microsoft Windows as part of the free Cygwin project. &lt;i&gt;Managing Projects with GNU make&lt;/i&gt;, 3rd Edition  provides guidelines on meeting the needs of large, modern projects. Also added are a number of interesting advanced topics such as portability, parallelism, and use with Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Mecklenburg, author of the third edition, has used &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; for decades with a variety of platforms and languages. In this book he zealously lays forth how to get your builds to be as efficient as possible, reduce maintenance, avoid errors, and thoroughly understand what &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt; is doing. Chapters on C++ and Java provide makefile entries optimized for projects in those languages. The author even includes a discussion of the makefile used to build the book. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Mac OS X: The Missing Manual, Panther Edition</title>
    <author>David Pogue</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple says that Mac OS X 10.3 introduces 150 new features--but that's not really true.  In fact, "Panther" includes many more than that.  It's faster, more polished, and much more efficient.  But it still comes without a manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 300,000 copies in print, the first two versions of this book became industry bestsellers.  Now David Pogue brings his humor and expertise to this completely rewritten, greatly expanded edition.  It covers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting started&lt;/b&gt;.  The early chapters demystify the Dock, windows, and the unfamiliar Mac OS X folder structure--an ideal introduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;New technologies&lt;/b&gt;.  Mac OS X 10.3 brings breakthroughs in window management (Expose, the Sidebar); security (File Vault, Secure Empty Trash); and productivity (faxing, Fast User Switching).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bonus software&lt;/b&gt;.  Panther comes with over 50 free programs--and this book gives you expertise in all of them.  This beefed-up edition includes all-new mini-manuals on iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto, iChat AV, and Safari.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Basics of Unix&lt;/b&gt;. You can completely ignore Panther's Unix core.  But if the command line intrigues you, this book offers a gentle introduction.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finding familiar features&lt;/b&gt;.  Two "Where'd It Go?" Dictionaries make it easy for Mac OS 9 and Windows refugees to look up a traditional feature--and find out where it went in Mac OS X 10.3.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
As always, &lt;i&gt;Mac OS X: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; offers warm, witty writing, and bursts with the shortcuts, surprises, and design touches that make the Mac the most passionately championed computer in the world. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;David Pogue's best-selling title offers a wealth of detail on the all of the changes in Apple's Mac OS X 10.3, aka "Panther". Written with humor and technical insight characteristic of the Missing Manual series, this edition covers everything from the all-new Finder to iChat AV--Apple's exciting tool for video conferencing. The book also deals with features under the hood, such as the Terminal and networking tools. Pogue, the renowned New York Times computer columnist, tackles his subject with scrupulous objectivity--revealing which new features work well and which do not. An authoritative book that will appeal to novices and experienced users alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of the best-selling &lt;i&gt;Java in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; has created an entire book of real-world Java programming examples that you can learn from. If you learn best "by example," this is the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This third edition covers Java 1.4 and contains 193 complete, practical examples: over 21,900 lines of densely commented, professionally written Java code, covering 20 distinct client-side and server-side APIs. It includes new chapters on the Java Sound API and the New I/O API.  The chapters on XML and servlets have been rewritten to cover the latest versions of the specifications and to demonstrate best practices for Java 1.4. New and updated examples throughout the book demonstrate many other new Java features and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Examples in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is a companion volume to &lt;i&gt;Java in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Java Foundation Classes in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Java Enterprise in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;. It picks up where those quick references leave off, providing a wealth of examples for both novices and experts.  This book doesn't hold your hand; it simply delivers well-commented working examples with succinct explanations to help you learn and explore Java and its APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Examples in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; contains examples that demonstrate:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core APIs, including I/O, New I/O, threads, networking, security, serialization, and reflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desktop APIs, highlighting Swing GUIs, Java 2D graphics, preferences, printing, drag-and-drop, JavaBeans, applets, and sound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise APIs, including JDBC (database access), JAXP (XML parsing and transformation), Servlets 2.4, JSP 2.0 (JavaServer Pages), and RMI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;The book begins with introductory examples demonstrating structured and object-oriented programming techniques for new Java programmers.  A special index at the end of the book makes it easy to look up examples that use a particular Java class or accomplish a desired task. In between, each chapter includes exercises that challenge readers and suggest further avenues for exploration.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Oracle Application Server offers a wide range of functionality, including Java runtime and development tools, portal development tools, business intelligence, single sign-on identify management, and much more.  It's so powerful and complex, in fact, that many people who use the product (or are considering using it) are familiar with only a portion of the entire range of its capabilities. The choices can be overwhelming. Few people grasp how the larger issues--such as the interplay between components or the various architectural choices in the product--play out in the Oracle Application Server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new guide provides the perfect introduction to the Oracle Application Server for users of any level.   Regardless of which of the server's capabilities you use, you'll benefit from this tightly focused, all-in-one technical overview. It's written for anyone who is concerned with using and managing web servers, doing Java development and deployment, using Oracle's own tools--like Forms and Reports, using or developing for Oracle Portal, or those who use and administer business intelligence, mobile or integration software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divided into three concise sections, the book covers server basics, core components, and server functionality. The book leads with the history of Oracle Application Server, its architecture, management, standards, and third-party support for languages and tools such as Java, Perl, and HTTP.  The next section covers Oracle's web server, containers for Java web caching, and the server's security features. And finally, the book discusses HTML development, Java development, and Oracle development.  Although the book refers mainly to Oracle Application Server 10g, the authors also describe features in earlier product releases where necessary, particularly Oracle9i Application Server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More comprehensible than a large reference and more detailed than a primer, the book provides a foundation for understanding and using Oracle Application Server effectively and efficiently. Readers concentrate on the most important issues and components of the server, focusing primarily on principles rather than syntax. Designed to be the ideal first OracleAS book, &lt;i&gt;Oracle Application Server 10g Essentials&lt;/i&gt; offers Oracle application developers and administrators everything they need to know about this powerful server.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Mastering FreeBSD and OpenBSD Security</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD and OpenBSD are increasingly gaining traction in educational institutions, non-profits, and corporations worldwide because they provide significant security advantages over Linux. Although a lot can be said for the robustness, clean organization, and stability of the BSD operating systems, security is one of the main reasons system administrators use these two platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of books to help you get a FreeBSD or OpenBSD system off the ground, and all of them touch on security to some extent, usually dedicating a chapter to the subject. But, as security is commonly named as the key concern for today's system administrators, a single chapter on the subject can't provide the depth of information you need to keep your systems secure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeBSD and OpenBSD are rife with security "building blocks" that you can put to use, and &lt;i&gt;Mastering FreeBSD and OpenBSD Security&lt;/i&gt; shows you how. Both operating systems have kernel options and filesystem features that go well beyond traditional Unix permissions and controls. This power and flexibility is valuable, but the colossal range of possibilities need to be tackled one step at a time.  This book walks you through the installation of a hardened operating system, the installation and configuration of critical services, and ongoing maintenance of your FreeBSD and OpenBSD systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an application-specific approach that builds on your existing knowledge, the book provides sound technical information on FreeBSD and Open-BSD security with plenty of real-world examples to help you configure and deploy a secure system.  By imparting a solid technical foundation as well as practical know-how, it enables administrators to push their server's security to the next level.  Even administrators in other environments--like Linux and Solaris--can find useful paradigms to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by security professionals with two decades of operating system experience, &lt;i&gt;Mastering FreeBSD and OpenBSD Security&lt;/i&gt; features broad and deep explanations of how how to secure your most critical systems.  Where other books on BSD systems help you achieve functionality, this book will help you more thoroughly secure your deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mastering FreeBSD and OpenBSD Security&lt;/i&gt; is the only book currently on the market devoted completely to BSD security.  Dozens of practical examples help administrators of all stripes select, configure, and deploy these operating systems.  By describing security solutions for real-life scenarios, this convenient guide lets administrators push their server's security to the next level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly's Pocket Guides have earned a reputation as inexpensive, comprehensive, and compact guides that have the stuff but not the fluff.  Every page of &lt;i&gt;Linux Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; lives up to this billing. It clearly explains how to get up to speed quickly on day-to-day Linux use. Once you're up and running, &lt;i&gt;Linux Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; provides an easy-to-use reference that you can keep by your keyboard for those times when you want a fast, useful answer, not hours in the man pages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Linux Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; is organized the way you use Linux: by function, not just alphabetically. It's not the 'bible of Linux; it's a practical and concise guide to the options and commands you need most. It starts with general concepts like files and directories, the shell, and X windows, and then presents detailed overviews of the most essential commands, with clear examples. You'll learn each command's purpose, usage, options, location on disk, and even the RPM package that installed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Linux Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; is tailored to Fedora Linux--the latest spin-off of Red Hat Linux--but most of the information applies to any Linux system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw in a host of valuable power user tips and a friendly and accessible style, and you'll quickly find this practical, to-the-point book a small but mighty resource for Linux users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of Oracle SQL books discuss some syntax, provide the barest rudiments of using Oracle SQL, and perhaps include a few simple examples. It might be enough to pass a survey course, or give you some buzz words to drop in conversation with real Oracle DBAs. But if you use Oracle SQL on a regular basis, you want much more. You want to access the full power of SQL to write queries in an Oracle environment. You want a solid understanding of what's possible with Oracle SQL, creative techniques for writing effective and accurate queries, and the practical, hands-on information that leads to true mastery of the language. Simply put, you want useful, expert best practices that can be put to work immediately, not just non-vendor specific overview or theory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated to cover the latest version of Oracle, Oracle 10g, this edition of the highly regarded &lt;i&gt;Mastering Oracle SQL&lt;/i&gt; has a stronger focus on technique and on Oracle's implementation of SQL than any other book on the market. It covers Oracle s vast library of built-in functions, the full range of Oracle SQL query-writing features, regular expression support, new aggregate and analytic functions, subqueries in the SELECT and WITH clauses, multiset union operators, enhanced support for hierarchical queries: leaf and loop detection, and the CONNECT_BY_ROOT operator, new partitioning methods (some introduced in Oracle9i Release 2), and the native XML datatype, XMLType.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mastering Oracle SQL&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition fills the gap between the sometimes spotty vendor documentation, and other books on SQL that just don't explore the full depth of what is possible with Oracle-specific SQL. For those who want to harness the untapped (and often overlooked) power of Oracle SQL, this essential guide for putting Oracle SQL to work will prove invaluable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practical reference guide offers hundreds of useful tasks for managing Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003, Microsoft's latest and greatest server.  Through concise, on-the-job solutions to common problems, &lt;i&gt;Windows Server Cookbook for Windows Server 2003 &amp;amp; Windows 2000&lt;/i&gt; is certain to save you hours of time searching for answers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, instead of dredging reams of Microsoft documentation or browsing its unstructured knowledge base to figure out a particular issue--such as how to compare registry values between two hosts--you can simply reference the index of &lt;i&gt;Windows Server Cookbook for Windows Server 2003 &amp;amp; Windows 2000&lt;/i&gt;.  From there, you'll be directed to the exact trouble-shooting recipe they need. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the newest title in O'Reilly's popular Cookbook series, this book covers a wide range of issues that you are likely to face in your daily management of the Windows Server operating system.  This includes how to deal with:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;files
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;event logs
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DNS
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DHCP
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;security
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the registry
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;backup/restore&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
One of the book's key benefits is the presentation of solutions in three different recipe formats.  Depending on preference, you can solve most problems with the graphical user interface, the command line, or by using scripts.  Where appropriate, all three solutions are presented for each recipe in this book.  Each recipe also includes a detailed discussion that explains how and why it works.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows Server Cookbook for Windows Server 2003 &amp;amp; Windows 2000&lt;/i&gt; is written for all levels of system administrators on Windows servers.  If you're a relatively new user with only a rudimentary understanding of the job, the book can open your eyes to the many possibilities that await.  And if you're an advanced user, it can serve as a useful reference and memory-jogger. &lt;/p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the XQuery 1.0 standard, you finally have a tool that will make it much easier to search, extract and manipulate information from XML content stored in databases. This in-depth tutorial not only walks you through the XQuery specification, but also teaches you how to program with this widely anticipated query language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;XQuery&lt;/em&gt; is for query writers who have some knowledge of XML basics, but not necessarily advanced knowledge of XML-related technologies. It can be used both as a tutorial, by reading cover to cover, and as a reference, by using the comprehensive index and appendixes. Either way, you will find the background knowledge in namespaces, schemas, built-in types and regular expressions that is relevant to writing XML queries. This book provides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A high-level overview and quick tour of XQuery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information to write sophisticated queries, without being bogged down by the details of types, namespaces, and schemas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced concepts for users who want to take advantage of modularity, namespaces, typing and schemas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guidelines for working with specific types of data, such as numbers, strings, dates, URIs and processing instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A complete alphabetical reference to the built-in functions and types&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also learn about XQuery's support for filtering, sorting, and grouping data, as well as how to use FLWOR expressions, XPath, and XQuery tools for extracting and combining information. With this book, you will discover how to apply all of these tools to a wide variety of data sources, and how to recombine information from multiple sources into a single final output result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you're coming from SQL, XSLT, or starting from scratch, this carefully paced tutorial takes you through the final 1.0 standard in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;XQuery&lt;/em&gt; delivers a carefully paced tutorial that goes into the final 1.0 standard in detail. The book delves into critical advanced issues such as data typing and designing efficient query logic. Whether you're coming from SQL, XSLT, or starting from scratch, you'll learn about XQuery's support for filtering, sorting, and grouping data, as well as how to use FLWR expressions, XPath, and XQuery tools for extracting and combining information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're using PHP 4, then chances are good that an upgrade to PHP 5 is in your future.  The more you've heard about the exciting new features in PHP 5, the sooner that upgrade is probably going to be. Although an in-depth, soup-to-nuts reference guide to the language is good to have on hand, it's not the book an experienced PHP programmer needs to get started with the latest release. What you need is a lean and focused guide that answers your most pressing questions: what's new with the technology, what's different, and how do I make the best use of it?  In other words, you need a copy of &lt;i&gt;Upgrading to PHP 5&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is targeted toward PHP developers who are already familiar with PHP 4.  Rather than serve as a definitive guide to the entire language, the book zeroes in on PHP 5's new features, and covers these features definitively. You'll find a concise appraisal of the differences between PHP 4 and PHP 5, a detailed look at what's new in this latest version, and you'll see how PHP 5 improves on PHP 4 code.  See PHP 4 and PHP 5 code side-by-side, to learn how the new features make it easier to solve common PHP problems.  Each new feature is shown in code, helping you understand why it's there, when to use it, and how it's better than PHP 4. Short, sample programs are included throughout the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered in &lt;i&gt;Upgrading to PHP 5&lt;/i&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The new set of robust object-oriented programming features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An improved MySQL extension, supporting MySQL 4.1, prepared statements, and bound parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely rewritten support for XML: DOM, XSLT, SAX, and SimpleXML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy web services with SOAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQLite, an embedded database library bundled with PHP 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleaner error handling with exceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other new language features, such as iterators, streams, and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;Upgrading to PHP 5&lt;/i&gt; won't make you wade through information you've covered before. Written by Adam Trachtenberg, coauthor of the popular &lt;i&gt;PHP Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, this book will take you straight into the heart of all that's new in PHP 5.  By the time you've finished, you'll know PHP 5 in practice as well as in theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is targeted toward PHP developers who are already familiar with PHP 4.  &lt;i&gt;Upgrading to PHP 5&lt;/i&gt; offers a concise appraisal of the differences between PHP 4 and PHP 5, a detailed look at what's new in this latest version, and an explanation of how these changes affect you.  The book also covers more advanced features and provides hands-on experienced through short, sample programs included throughout. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unique and valuable collection of tips, tools, and scripts provides clear, concise, hands-on solutions that can be applied to the challenges facing anyone running a network of Linux servers from small networks to large data centers in the practical and popular problem-solution-discussion O'Reilly cookbook format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Linux Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; covers everything you'd expect: backups, new users, and the like. But it also covers the non-obvious information that is often ignored in other books the time-sinks and headaches that are a real part of an administrator's job, such as: dealing with odd kinds of devices that Linux historically hasn't supported well, building multi-boot systems, and handling things like video and audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knowledge needed to install, deploy, and maintain Linux is not easily found, and no Linux distribution gets it just right. Scattered information can be found in a pile of man pages, texinfo files, and source code comments, but the best source of information is the experts themselves who built up a working knowledge of managing Linux systems. This cookbook's proven techniques distill years of hard-won experience into practical cut-and-paste solutions to everyday Linux dilemmas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use just one  recipe  from this varied collection of real-world solutions, and the hours of tedious trial-and-error saved will more than pay for the cost of the book. But those who prefer to learn hands-on will find that this cookbook not only solves immediate problems quickly, it also cuts right to the chase pointing out potential pitfalls and illustrating tested practices that can be applied to a myriad of other situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're responsible for a small Linux system, a huge corporate system, or a mixed Linux/Windows/MacOS network, you'll find valuable, to-the-point, practical recipes for dealing with Linux systems everyday. The &lt;i&gt;Linux Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is more than a time-saver; it's a sanity saver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java programmers know how finicky Java can be to work with. An omitted semi-colon or the slightest typo will cause the Java command-line compiler to spew pages of annoying error messages across your screen.  And it doesn't fix them--that's up to you: fix them, compile again, and hope that nothing goes wrong this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipse, the popular Java integrated development environment (IDE) provides an elegant and powerful remedy for this common, frustrating scenario.  It doesn't just catch your errors before you compile, it also suggests solutions. All you need to do is point and click. And it's free--what could be better? Still, if you're like most programmers, mastering a new technology--no matter how productive it will make you in the long run--is going to take a chunk out of your productivity now. You want to get up to speed quickly without sacrificing efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly's new guide to the technology, &lt;i&gt;Eclipse&lt;/i&gt;, provides exactly what you're looking for: a fast-track approach to mastery of Eclipse.  This insightful, hands-on book delivers clear and concise coverage, with no fluff, that gets down to business immediately. The book is tightly focused, covering all aspects of Eclipse: the menus, preferences, views, perspectives, editors, team and debugging techniques, and how they're used every day by thousands of developers.  Development of practical skills is emphasized with dozens of examples presented throughout the book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From cover-to-cover, the book is pure Eclipse, covering hundreds of techniques beginning with the most basic Java development through creating your own plug-in editors for the Eclipse environment. Some of the topics you'll learn about include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Eclipse to develop Java code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing and debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working in teams using CVS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building Eclipse projects using Ant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing Struts applications with Eclipse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
From basics to advanced topics, &lt;i&gt;Eclipse&lt;/i&gt; takes you through the fundamentals of Eclipse and more. You may be an Eclipse novice when you pick up the book, but you'll be a pro by the time you've finished. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core idea behind Real World Web Services is simple: after years of hype, what are the major players really doing with web services? Standard bodies may wrangle and platform vendors may preach, but at the end of the day what are the technologies that are actually in use, and how can developers incorporate them into their own applications?  Those are the answers &lt;i&gt;Real World Web Services&lt;/i&gt; delivers. It's a field guide to the wild and wooly world of non-trivial deployed web services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of the book is a series of projects, demonstrating the use and integration of Google, Amazon, eBay, PayPal, FedEx, and many more web services. Some of these vendors have been extremely successful with their web service deployments: for example, eBay processes over a billion web service requests a month!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author focuses on building 8 fully worked out example web applications that incorporate the best web services available today.  The book thoroughly documents how to add functionality like automating listings for auctions, dynamically calculating shipping fees, automatically sending faxes to your suppliers, using an aggregator to pull data from multiple news and web service feeds into a single format or monitoring the latest weblog discussions and Google searches to keep web site visitors on top of topics of interest-by integrating APIs from popular websites most people are already familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each example application, the author provides a thorough overview, architecture, and full working code examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book doesn't engage in an intellectual debate as to the  correctness  of web services on a theological level.  Instead, it focuses on the practical, real world usage of web services as the latest evolution in distributed computing, allowing for structured communication via Internet protocols.  As you ll see, this includes everything from sending HTTP GET commands to retrieving an XML document through the use of SOAP and various vendor SDKs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

Or an experienced trader who wants to make the jump to power buyer or seller? &lt;i&gt;eBay: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; gives you the inside information you'll need to become an eBay expert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers will find the most effective ways to find you want and pay prices that are sure to bring a smile to your face.  And you'll get authoritative advice on strategic bidding: how to watch for elusive items, time your bids to take the competition by surprise, and--above all--avoid paying more than you ought to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sellers will get sure-fire tips from eBay veterans who have discovered ways to ramp up their own auctions and sell at the highest possible prices.  From the smallest details, such as how to take and post the most effective photos of your goods, to pricing strategies, inventory management, and shipping methods, this user-friendly manual will help you make more money on eBay. Whether you're selling a single item or running fulltime business on the site, you'll find tips to help you do it more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in any community, problems and disputes arise, and you'll learn how other eBayers resolve such troubles or work around them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;eBay: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; has gems of wisdom for everyone from total novices to more experienced traders.  If you're looking to improve your eBay auction experience, you'll savor the tips and trick revealed in this guided exploration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;eBay is a great bazaar for things of all kinds--size 14 purple sneakers, porcelain Donald Duck figurines, cases of D-cell batteries, vintage Edsels. It's a terrific way to shop, but it's enormous, and it's systems for buying and selling things are not straightforward. &lt;i&gt;eBay: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is a friendly guide to getting started with--and then getting more out of--the popular auction site. The book covers both buying and selling, and it's chock full of step-by-step instructions and tips for beginners and experienced traders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the secrets to the ever-increasing popularity of Windows Server can be found in the simplicity its administration. The easy-to-use GUI, consistent set of tools, and wizards that walk you through complex tasks allow you to install, configure and maintain Windows servers without any knowledge of programming or scripting languages or learning complicated command-line syntax. It's possible, in fact, to accomplish about 90% of all Windows administration without ever opening a command prompt or running a script! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the other ten percent of the time? While it's true that most common, day-to-day tasks of Windows administration can be performed from the GUI, it's not always the best way, especially with complex or repetitive tasks Scripts and command-line tools often provide a faster, more flexible approach.  &lt;i&gt;Windows Server Hacks&lt;/i&gt; reveals techniques that go well beyond basic management tasks found in most handbooks to help busy system administrators master the more powerful features of Windows Server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows Server Hacks&lt;/i&gt; focuses on scripts and other tools that will make your life as an administrator much easier. These tools, or hacks--quick and dirty solutions to problems, or clever ways of doing things--were created by other professionals who've also had to struggle to find solutions to administering Windows environments. You'll save valuable time using their scripts, tools, tips, and advice. Plus, you can easily learn to customize the scripts to create even more powerful tools for your own, specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book includes secrets of the masters in such areas as Active Directory, User Management, Group Policy, DNS and DHCP, File and Print, IIS, performance and security.  The hundred, industrial strength hacks in the book range from those that deal with general administration to more esoteric hacks in the areas of network deployment, patch management, and backup and recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter which Windows server you use--NT, IIS, 2000, or 2003--this book will put the knowledge and expertise of veteran system administrators and hackers to work for you. &lt;i&gt;Windows Server Hacks&lt;/i&gt; will make your life easier while expanding your understanding of the capabilities of Windows Server. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;GNU Emacs is the most popular and widespread of the Emacs family of editors. It is also the most powerful and flexible. Unlike all other text editors, GNU Emacs is a complete working environment--you can stay within Emacs all day without leaving. &lt;i&gt;Learning GNU Emacs&lt;/i&gt;, 3rd Edition tells readers how to get started with the GNU Emacs editor. It is a thorough guide that will also "grow" with you: as you become more proficient, this book will help you learn how to use Emacs more effectively. It takes you from basic Emacs usage (simple text editing) to moderately complicated customization and programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third edition of &lt;i&gt;Learning GNU Emacs&lt;/i&gt; describes Emacs 21.3 from the ground up, including new user interface features such as an icon-based toolbar and an interactive interface to Emacs customization.  A new chapter details how to install and run Emacs on Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux, including tips for using Emacs effectively on those platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning GNU Emacs&lt;/i&gt;, third edition, covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to edit files with Emacs
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using the operating system shell through Emacs
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to use multiple buffers, windows, and frames
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customizing Emacs interactively and through startup files
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing macros to circumvent repetitious tasks
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emacs as a programming environment for Java, C++, and Perl, among others
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using Emacs as an integrated development environment (IDE)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrating Emacs with CVS, Subversion and other change control systems for projects with multiple developers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing HTML, XHTML, and XML with Emacs
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basics of Emacs Lisp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The book is aimed at new Emacs users, whether or not they are programmers. Also useful for readers switching from other Emacs implementations to GNU Emacs. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the look and feel of an enterprise web application is certainly important, developers usually find themselves spending far too much time on the front-end presentation before they can get to coding the good stuff--the business logic at the heart of the program. Jakarta Struts addresses this issue by combining Java Servlets, Java ServerPages (JSP), custom tags, and messaging resources (like Java Message Service) into a unified, re-usable framework. The result is a cooperative, synergistic platform that's efficient and suitable for independent developers, large development teams, and everyone in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Struts Framework has become a highly popular open source project, but there's still woefully little documentation on the technology. What does exist is far too basic and lacks critical information for developers like you writing today's complex web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revised and expanded &lt;i&gt;Programming Jakarta Struts&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition covers everything the successful earlier edition did--including an overview of the concepts involved in writing web applications; installation and configuration instructions for getting Struts up and running; a thorough discussion of how Struts implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm (known as the Model 2 approach) and how to interface with that pattern in your own applications; Logging, Validation, and Exception Handling with Struts; using Tiles; writing internationalization and localization code using Struts; and practical, real-world best practices for web applications--as well as plenty more: now fully up to date with Struts 1.1, this edition covers the latest material on tag libraries and the new JavaServerFaces (JSF) APIs and even includes all-new chapters on JSF, JSTL/EL, and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With each enterprise system he s developed, author Chuck Cavaness has spent many grueling hours learning invaluable lessons about Struts and figuring out the dos and the don'ts of building web applications. He saves you time and headaches by sharing that invaluable real-world experience here, with his realistic, practical,  here's how to do it  approach to using the Struts Framework to its fullest potential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to use the Struts Framework to its fullest potential, this is the book for you. &lt;i&gt;Programming Jakarta Struts&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition covers everything the successful earlier edition did as well as plenty more: now fully up to date with Struts 1.1, this edition covers the latest material on tag libraries and the new JavaServerFaces (JSF) APIs and even includes all-new chapters on JSF, JSTL/EL, and security. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2003, Macromedia released Flash MX 2004, and with it, ActionScript 2.0, a dramatically improved version of Flash's programming language.  ActionScript 2.0 introduces a formal object-oriented programming syntax and methodology for creating Flash applications.  From a developer's perspective, the new OOP-based techniques in ActionScript 2.0 make applications more natural to plan and conceptualize, more stable, more reusable across projects, easier to maintain, change, and expand upon, and much more. In short, they enhance the entire development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Essential ActionScript 2.0&lt;/i&gt;, bestselling author Colin Moock--one of the most universally respected developers in the Flash community--covers everything you'll need to know about the new ActionScript language and its methodologies for producing movies, animation, and applications on the web. Moock guides readers through this important new territory with his trademark easy-to-understand style and expertise. Moock's goal throughout the book is not just to get you to use object-oriented programming in your daily Flash work: he wants you to reap the benefits of OOP; he wants you to understand ActionScript 2.0 completely.  And without question, Moock is the author who can make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Essential ActionScript 2.0&lt;/i&gt; begins with a tour of the language, including the fundamentals of object-oriented concepts, syntax, and usage. Those who are new to OOP will learn the basics and how to apply their understanding. Those who are familiar with OOP will leverage their prior experience to learn about Flash-based OOP. The next part of the book shows how to structure entire applications with ActionScript 2.0, teaching you best practices and techniques to build scalable, extensible, stable apps. Next, you'll explore a variety of approaches to various programming situations by applying object-oriented programming strategies, known as design patterns, to Flash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experienced Flash developers and programmers coming from other languages will enjoy the sheer depth of Moocks's coverage and expertise in &lt;i&gt;Essential ActionScript 2.0&lt;/i&gt;. Novice programmers will appreciate the frequent, low-jargon explanations that are often glossed over by advanced programming books.  As usual, Moock guarantees quality and accuracy by working closely with Macromedia Flash engineers, including Rebecca Sun, lead developer of ActionScript 2.0.&lt;br/&gt;
Whether you're ready to make the move to ActionScript 2.0 now or simply assessing it for the future, you'll find everything you need to know within this book. &lt;i&gt;Essential ActionScript 2.0&lt;/i&gt; is the one book every ActionScript coder must own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>AspectJ Cookbook</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Object Oriented programming (OO) first appeared, it was a revelation. OO gave developers the ability to create software that was more flexible and robust, but as time went on and applications became more sophisticated, too, certain areas of "traditional" OO architectures were found wanting. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) addresses those issues by extending the OO approach even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many developers are interested in AOP--especially in AspectJ, the open source extension of the Java programming language that explicitly supports the AOP approach. Yet, although AspectJ is included with Eclipse, the increasingly popular open source IDE for Java, finding a practical and non-theoretical way to learn this language and other AOP tools and techniques has been a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now. The &lt;i&gt;AspectJ Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; offers a hands-on solution--in fact, several--with a wide variety of code recipes for solving day-to-day design and coding problems using AOP's unique approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOP allows the global properties of a program to determine how it's compiled into an executable program. Before AOP, important program design decisions were difficult to capture in actual code. Instead, the implementation of those design decisions--known as "aspects"--were scattered throughout, resulting in "tangled" code that was hard to develop and maintain. AOP has been compared to the manufacturing of cloth, in which threads are automatically interwoven. Without AOP, programmers must stitch the threads by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;AspectJ Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; shows readers why, and how, common Java development problems can be solved by using AOP techniques. With our popular problem-solution-discussion format, the book presents real world examples to demonstrate that AOP is more than just a concept; it's a development process that will benefit users in an immediate and visible manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in how AOP is changing the way software is developed, and how you can use AspectJ to make code more modular, easier to develop, maintain, evolve and deploy, this is the book that really delivers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDF--to most of the world it stands for that rather tiresome format used for documents downloaded from the web.  Slow to load and slower to print, hopelessly unsearchable, and all but impossible to cut and paste from, the Portable Document Format doesn't inspire much affection in the average user. But PDFs done right is another story.  Those who know the ins and outs of this format know that it can be much more than electronic paper.  Flexible, compact, interactive, and even searchable, PDF is the ideal way to present content across multiple platforms.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;PDF Hacks&lt;/i&gt; unveils the true promise of Portable Document Format, going way beyond the usual PDF as paged output mechanism. PDF expert Sid Steward draws from his years of analyzing, extending, authoring, and embellishing PDF documents to present 100 clever hacks--tools, tips, quick-and-dirty or not-so-obvious solutions to common problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;PDF Hacks&lt;/i&gt; will show you how to create PDF documents that are far more powerful than simple representations of paper pages. The hacks in the book cover the full range of PDF functionality, from the simple to the more complex, including generating, manipulating, annotating, and consuming PDF information.  You'll learn how to manage content in PDF, navigate it, and reuse it as necessary. Far more than another guide to Adobe Acrobat, the book covers a variety of readily available tools for generating, deploying, and editing PDF.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The little-known tips and tricks in this book are ideal for anyone who works with PDF on a regular basis, including web developers, pre-press users, forms creators, and those who generate PDF for distribution. Whether you want to fine-tune and debug your existing PDF documents or explore the full potential the format offers, &lt;i&gt;PDF Hacks&lt;/i&gt; will turn you into a PDF power user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being highly flexible in building dynamic, database-driven web applications makes the PHP programming language one of the most popular web development tools in use today. It also works beautifully with other open source tools, such as the MySQL database and the Apache web server. However, as more web sites are developed in PHP, they become targets for malicious attackers, and developers need to prepare for the attacks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Security is an issue that demands attention, given the growing frequency of attacks on web sites. &lt;i&gt;Essential PHP Security&lt;/i&gt; explains the most common types of attacks and how to write code that isn't susceptible to them. By examining specific attacks and the techniques used to protect against them, you will have a deeper understanding and appreciation of the safeguards you are about to learn in this book.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the much-needed (and highly-requested) &lt;i&gt;Essential PHP Security&lt;/i&gt;, each chapter covers an aspect of a web application (such as form processing, database programming, session management, and authentication).  Chapters describe potential attacks with examples and then explain techniques to help you prevent those attacks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Topics covered include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protecting against SQL injection attacks
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complicating session hijacking attempts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are in good hands with author Chris Shiflett, an internationally-recognized expert in the field of PHP security. Shiflett is also the founder and President of Brain Bulb, a PHP consultancy that offers a variety of services to clients around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The PHP scripting language works beautifully with other open source tools, such as the MySQL database and Apache web server software, to build interactive web applications. But security is still an issue that developers need to address, given the frequency of attacks on web sites. &lt;i&gt;Essential PHP Security&lt;/i&gt; explains the types of attacks that hackers use on web sites and how to correctly configure Apache and PHP to guard against them. The author of &lt;i&gt;Essential PHP Security&lt;/i&gt;, Chris Shiflett, is an internationally recognized expert in the field of PHP security and this book shows developers how to guard against attacks by writing secure PHP code. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;It's little wonder that longtime Windows users are migrating in droves to the new Mac. They're fed up with the virus-prone Windows way of life, and they're lured by Apple's well-deserved reputation for producing great all-around computers that are reliable, user-friendly, well designed, and now--with the $500 Mac mini--extremely affordable, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Whether you're drawn to the Mac's stability, its stunning digital media suite, or the fact that a whole computer can look and feel as slick as your iPod, you can quickly and easily become a Mac convert. But consider yourself warned: a Mac isn't just a Windows machine in a prettier box; it's a whole different animal and a whole new computing experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If you're contemplating--or have already made--the switch from a Windows PC to a Mac, you need &lt;i&gt;Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Tiger Edition&lt;/i&gt;. This incomparable guide delivers what Apple doesn't: everything you need to know to successfully and painlessly move to a Mac. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The latest reprint of this book has been updated to reflect the new generation of Mac models that run on Intel chips. There's even a new appendix that guides you through the installation of Windows XP on your Macintosh (using adapter software like Boot Camp or Parallels), so that you have the best of all worlds: a single, beautiful machine that can run 100 percent of the world's desktop software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Missing Manual series creator and bestselling author David Pogue teams up with 17-year-old whiz kid and founder of GoldfishSoft (www.goldfishsoft.com) Adam Goldstein to cover every aspect of switching to a Mac--things like transferring email, files, and addresses from a PC to a Mac; getting acquainted with the Mac's interface; adapting to Mac versions of familiar programs (including Microsoft Office); setting up a network to share files with PCs and Macs; and using the printers, scanners, and other peripherals you already own.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Covering the latest in Mac OS X v.10.4 "Tiger," &lt;i&gt;Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Tiger Edition&lt;/i&gt; explains the hundreds of innovative new features to the Mac OS and how you can understand and make the very most of each.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Whether you're a novice or a power user, &lt;i&gt;Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Tiger Edition&lt;/i&gt;, teaches you how to smoothly and seamlessly replace (or supplement) your Windows machine--in a refreshingly funny and down-to-earth style--with a mighty Mac.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrusion detection is not for the faint at heart. But, if you are a network administrator chances are you're under increasing pressure to ensure that mission-critical systems are safe--in fact impenetrable--from malicious code, buffer overflows, stealth port scans, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, CGI attacks, and other network intruders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing a reliable way to detect intruders before they get in is a vital but daunting challenge. Because of this, a plethora of complex, sophisticated, and pricy software solutions are now available. In terms of raw power and features, SNORT, the most commonly used Open Source Intrusion Detection System, (IDS) has begun to eclipse many expensive proprietary IDSes. In terms of documentation or ease of use, however, SNORT can seem overwhelming. Which output plugin to use?  How do you to email alerts to yourself? Most importantly, how do you sort through the immense amount of information Snort makes available to you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many intrusion detection books are long on theory but short on specifics and practical examples. Not &lt;i&gt;Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools&lt;/i&gt;.  This new book is a thorough, exceptionally practical guide to managing network security using Snort 2.1 (the latest release) and dozens of other high-quality open source other open source intrusion detection programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools&lt;/i&gt; covers reliable methods for detecting network intruders, from using simple packet sniffers to more sophisticated IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) applications and the GUI interfaces for managing them. A comprehensive but concise guide for monitoring illegal entry attempts, this invaluable new book explains how to shut down and secure workstations, servers, firewalls, routers, sensors and other network devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step-by-step instructions are provided to quickly get up and running with Snort. Each chapter includes links for the programs discussed, and additional links at the end of the book give administrators access to numerous web sites for additional information and instructional material that will satisfy even the most serious security enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools&lt;/i&gt; maps out a proactive--and effective--approach to keeping your systems safe from attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We are living in the computer age, in a world increasingly designed and engineered by computer programmers and software designers, by people who call themselves hackers. Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age&lt;/i&gt;, by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls "an intellectual Wild West."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Written in clear, narrative style, Hackers &amp;amp; Painters examines issues such as the rightness of web-based applications, the programming language renaissance, spam filtering, the Open Source Movement, internet startups and more. In each essay, Graham moves beyond widely held beliefs about the way that programmers work as he tells important stories about the kinds of people behind tech innovations, revealing distinctions about their characters and their craft. No hackers reading this book will fail to recognize themselves within these pages. No programmer will put it down without new thoughts actively percolating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And here's a taste of what you'll find in &lt;i&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Painters&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"In most fields the great work is done early on. The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed. Shakespeare appeared just as professional theater was being born, and pushed the medium so far that every playwright since has had to live in his shadow. Albrecht Durer did the same thing with engraving, and Jane Austen with the novel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Over and over we see the same pattern. A new medium appears, and people are so excited about it that they explore most of its possibilities in the first couple generations. Hacking seems to be in this phase now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Painting was not, in Leonardo's time, as cool as his work helped make it. How cool hacking turns out to be will depend on what we can do with this new medium."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Andy Hertzfeld, co-creator of the Macintosh computer, says about &lt;i&gt;Hackers &amp;amp; Painters&lt;/i&gt;:
"Paul Graham is a hacker, painter and a terrific writer.  His lucid, humorous prose is brimming with contrarian insight and practical wisdom on writing great code at the intersection of art, science and commerce."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Paul Graham, designer of the new Arc language, was the creator of Yahoo Store, the first web-based application. In addition to his PhD in Computer Science from Harvard, Graham also studied painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical organization, there's always plenty that to do such as: pay vendors, invoice customers, answer customer inquiries, and fix bugs in hardware or software. You need to know who wants what and keep track of what is left to do.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This is where a ticketing system comes in.  A ticketing system allows you to check the status of various tasks: when they were requested, who requested them and why, when they were completed, and more. RT is a high-level, open source ticketing system efficiently enabling a group of people to manage tasks, issues, and requests submitted by a community of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;RT Essentials&lt;/i&gt;, co-written by one of the RT's original core developers, Jesse Vincent, starts off with a quick background lesson about ticketing systems and then shows you how to install and configure RT.  This comprehensive guide explains how to perform day-to-day tasks to turn your RT server into a highly useful tracking tool.  One way it does this is by examining how a company could use RT to manage its internal processes.  Advanced chapters focus on developing add-on tools and utilities using Perl and Mason.  There's also chapter filled with suggested uses for RT inside your organization.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
No matter what kind of data your organization tracks--from sales inquiries to security incidents or anything in between--&lt;i&gt;RT Essentials&lt;/i&gt; helps you use RT to provide order when you need it most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive guide shows you how to customize RT--the widely used request ticketing system--to better fit your organization's business needs.  After introducing you to what ticketing systems are, the book shows you how to install and configure RT.  From there, it explains how to perform simple tasks that will turn your RT server into a highly useful tracking tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux consistently appears high up in the list of popular Internet servers, whether it's for the Web, anonymous FTP, or general services such as DNS and delivering mail. But security is the foremost concern of anyone providing such a service. Any server experiences casual probe attempts dozens of time a day, and serious break-in attempts with some frequency as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This highly regarded book, originally titled &lt;i&gt;Building Secure Servers with Linux&lt;/i&gt;, combines practical advice with a firm knowledge of the technical tools needed to ensure security. The book focuses on the most common use of Linux--as a hub offering services to an organization or the Internet--and shows readers how to harden their hosts against attacks. An all-inclusive resource for Linux users who wish to harden their systems, &lt;i&gt;Linux Server Security&lt;/i&gt; covers general security such as intrusion detection and firewalling a hub, as well as key services such as DNS, the Apache Web server, mail, and secure shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Michael D. Bauer, a security consultant, network architect, and lead author of the popular Paranoid Penguin column in the &lt;i&gt;Linux Journal&lt;/i&gt;, carefully outlines the security risks, defines precautions that can minimize those risks, and offers recipes for robust security. He is joined on several chapters by administrator and developer Bill Lubanovic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of new security topics have been added for this edition, including:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Database security, with a focus on MySQL
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using OpenLDAP for authentication
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An introduction to email encryption
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Cyrus IMAP service, a popular mail delivery agent
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vsftpd FTP server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Geared toward Linux users with little security expertise, the author explains security concepts and techniques in clear language, beginning with the fundamentals. &lt;i&gt;Linux Server Security&lt;/i&gt; with Linux provides a unique balance of "big picture" principles that transcend specific software packages and version numbers, and very clear procedures on securing some of those software packages on several popular distributions. With this book in hand, you'll have both the expertise and the tools to comprehensively secure your Linux system. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Linux Server Security&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition expertly conveys to administrators and developers the tricks of the trade that can help them avoid serious security breaches.  It covers both background theory and practical step-by-step instructions for protecting a server that runs Linux.  Packed with examples, this must-have book lets the good guys stay one step ahead of potential adversaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class="book-subtitle"&gt;Academic Supplement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wil Wheaton--&lt;a href="http://www.wilwheaton.net"&gt;blogger&lt;/a&gt;, geek, and Star Trek: The Next Generation's Wesley Crusher--gives us five short-but-true tales of life in the so-called Space Age in &lt;i&gt;Dancing Barefoot&lt;/i&gt;. With a true geek's unflinching honesty, Wil examines life, love, the web, and the absurdities of Hollywood in these compelling autobiographical narratives. Based on pieces first published in Wil's hugely popular blog, www.wilwheaton.net, the stories in &lt;i&gt;Dancing Barefoot&lt;/i&gt; chronicle a teen TV star's journey to maturity and self-acceptance.  Far from the usual celebrity tell-all, &lt;i&gt;Dancing Barefoot&lt;/i&gt; is a vivid account of one man's version of that universal story, the search for self. If you've ever fallen in love, wondered what goes on behind the scenes at a Star Trek convention, or thought hard about the meaning of life, you'll find a kindred soul in the pages of Dancing Barefoot. In the process of uncovering his true geeky self, Wil Wheaton speaks to the inner geek in all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houses in Motion - Memories fill the emptiness left within a childhood home, and saying goodbye brings them to life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready Or Not Here I Come - A game of hide-n-seek with the kids works as a time machine, taking Wil on a tour of the hiding and seeking of years gone by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inferno - Two 15-year-olds pass in the night leaving behind pleasant memories and a perfumed Car Wars Deluxe Edition Box Set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We Close Our Eyes - A few beautiful moments spent dancing in the rain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saga of SpongeBob VegasPants - A story of love, hate, laughter and the acceptance of all things Trek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large IT organizations increasingly face the challenge of integrating various web services, applications, and other technologies into a single network.  The solution to finding a meaningful large-scale architecture that is capable of spanning a global enterprise appears to have been met in ESB, or Enterprise Service Bus.  Rather than conform to the hub-and-spoke architecture of traditional enterprise application integration products, ESB provides a highly distributed approach to integration, with unique capabilities that allow individual departments or business units to build out their integration projects in incremental, digestible chunks, maintaining their own local control and autonomy, while still being able to connect together each integration project into a larger, more global integration fabric, or grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enterprise Service Bus&lt;/i&gt; offers a thorough introduction and overview for systems architects, system integrators, technical project leads, and CTO/CIO level managers who need to understand, assess, and evaluate this new approach. Written by Dave Chappell, one of the best known and authoritative voices in the field of enterprise middleware and standards-based integration, the book drills down into the technical details of the major components of ESB, showing how it can utilize an event-driven SOA to bring a variety of enterprise applications and services built on J2EE, .NET, C/C++, and other legacy environments into the reach of the everyday IT professional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Enterprise Service Bus&lt;/i&gt;, readers become well versed in the problems faced by IT organizations today, gaining an understanding of how current technology deficiencies impact business issues. Through the study of real-world use cases and integration patterns drawn from several industries using ESB--including Telcos, financial services, retail, B2B exchanges, energy, manufacturing, and more--the book clearly and coherently outlines the benefits of moving toward this integration strategy.  The book also compares ESB to other integration architectures, contrasting their inherent strengths and limitations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are charged with understanding, assessing, or implementing an integration architecture, &lt;i&gt;Enterprise Service Bus&lt;/i&gt; will provide the straightforward information you need to draw your conclusions about this important disruptive technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enterprise Service Bus&lt;/i&gt; provides an architectural overview of the ESB, showing how it can bring the task of integration of enterprise applications and services built on J2EE, .NET, C/C++, and other legacy environments into the reach of the everyday IT professional, using an event-driven Service-Oriented Architecture.  Through the study of real-world use cases drawn from several industries using ESB, the book clearly and coherently outlines the benefits of moving toward this integration strategy. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the simplest answer is the best. Many Enterprise Java developers, accustomed to dealing with Java's spiraling complexity, have fallen into the habit of choosing overly complicated solutions to problems when simpler options are available. Building server applications with "heavyweight" Java-based architectures, such as WebLogic, JBoss, and WebSphere, can be costly and cumbersome. When you've reached the point where you spend more time writing code to support your chosen framework than to solve your actual problems, it's time to think in terms of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Better, Faster, Lighter Java&lt;/i&gt;, authors Bruce Tate and Justin Gehtland argue that the old heavyweight architectures are unwieldy, complicated, and contribute to slow and buggy application code.  As an alternative means for building better applications, the authors present two "lightweight" open source architectures: Hibernate--a persistence framework that does its job with a minimal API and gets out of the way, and Spring--a container that's not invasive, heavy or complicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hibernate and Spring are designed to be fairly simple to learn and use, and place reasonable demands on system resources. &lt;i&gt;Better, Faster, Lighter Java&lt;/i&gt; shows you how they can help you create enterprise applications that are easier to maintain, write, and debug, and are ultimately much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written for intermediate to advanced Java developers, &lt;i&gt;Better, Faster, Lighter Java&lt;/i&gt;, offers fresh ideas--often unorthodox--to help you rethink the way you work, and techniques and principles you'll use to build simpler applications.  You'll learn to spend more time on what's important. When you're finished with this book, you'll find that your Java is better, faster, and lighter than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Access Cookbook</title>

    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a reference book, and not a tutorial either, the new second edition of the highly regarded &lt;i&gt;Access Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is an uncommonly useful collection of solutions to problems that Access users and developers are likely to face as they attempt to build increasingly complex applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although using any single "recipe" in the book will more than pay back the cost of the book in terms of both hours saved and frustration thwarted, &lt;i&gt;Access Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, Second Edition is much more than a handy assortment of cut-and-paste code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the "recipes" examine a particular problem--problems that commonly occur when you push the upper limits of Access, or ones that are likely to trip up a developer attempting to design a more elegant Access application--even some things you never knew Access could do.  The authors then, in a clear, accessible, step-by-step style, present the problems' solution. Following each "recipe" are insights on how Access works, potential pitfalls, interesting programming techniques that are used in the solution, and how and why the solution works, so you can adapt the problem-solving techniques to other similar situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully updated for Access 2003, &lt;i&gt;Access Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, Second Edition is also one of the first books to thoroughly explore new support for .NET managed code and XML. All of the practical, real-world examples have been tested for compatibility with Access 2003, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. This updated new edition also covers Access and SharePoint, Access and SmartTags, Access and .NET; and Access and XML. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access power users and programmers at all levels, from the relatively inexperienced to the most sophisticated, will rely on the &lt;i&gt;Access Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; for quick solutions to gnarly problems. With a dog-eared copy of &lt;i&gt;Access Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; at your side, you can spend your time and energy where it matters most: working on the interesting facets of your Access application, not just the time-consuming ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world of Unix operating systems, the various BSDs come with a long heritage of high-quality software and well-designed solutions, making them a favorite OS of a wide range of users. Among budget-minded users who adopted BSD early on to developers of some of today's largest Internet sites, the popularity of BSD systems continues to grow.  If you use the BSD operating system, then you know that the secret of its success is not just in its price tag: practical, reliable, extraordinarily stable and flexible, BSD also offers plenty of fertile ground for creative, time-saving tweaks and tricks, and yes, even the chance to have some fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Fun?" you ask.  Perhaps "fun" wasn't covered in the manual that taught you to install BSD and administer it effectively. But &lt;i&gt;BSD Hacks&lt;/i&gt;, the latest in O'Reilly's popular Hacks series, offers a unique set of practical tips, tricks, tools--and even fun--for administrators and power users of BSD systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;BSD Hacks&lt;/i&gt; takes a creative approach to saving time and getting more done, with fewer resources.  You'll take advantage of the tools and concepts that make the world's top Unix users more productive. Rather than spending hours with a dry technical document learning what switches go with a command, you'll learn concrete, practical uses for that command.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book begins with hacks to customize the user environment. You'll learn how to be more productive in the command line, timesaving tips for setting user-defaults, how to automate long commands, and save long sessions for later review. Other hacks in the book are grouped in the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customizing the User Environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with Files and Filesystems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Boot and Login Environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backing Up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking Hacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing the System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going Beyond the Basics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping Up-to-Date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grokking BSD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If you want more than your average BSD user--you want to explore and experiment, unearth shortcuts, create useful tools, and come up with fun things to try on your own--&lt;i&gt;BSD Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is a must-have. This book will turn regular users into power users and system administrators into super system administrators.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detailed information on the basics of the PHP language, including data types, variables, operators, and flow control statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapters outlining the basics of functions, strings, arrays, and objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coverage of common PHP web application techniques, such as form processing and validation, session tracking, and cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Material on interacting with relational databases, such as MySQL and Oracle, using the database-independent PEAR DB library and the new PDO Library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapters that show you how to generate dynamic images, create PDF files, and parse XML files with PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced topics, such as creating secure scripts, error handling, performance tuning, and writing your own C language extensions to PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A handy quick reference to all the core functions in PHP and all the standard extensions that ship with PHP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the success of computer viruses like Slammer, security issues are now a top priority for Windows system administrators, right alongside day-to-day tasks such as setting up accounts and managing performance. If you use Windows 2003 Server at a small to medium-sized organization, or use Microsoft's Small Business Server, this thorough yet concise tutorial offers the hands-on advice you need for securing your network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern network operating systems include bundled services that range from traditional file and print sharing and Internet services to authentication, directory and remote access services each a potential security vulnerability as well as a capability. &lt;i&gt;Securing Windows Server 2003&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to put Windows security tools to work, and how to run the server's subsystems to protect users and resources. But that's just the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network security needs to be well thought-out, not treated as a fire drill when a threat occurs. This book focuses primarily on ways to plan and implement a secure operating environment. Microsoft security veteran Mike Danseglio uses real-world examples to show you how various security concepts relate to your own system, including:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;File System Security
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li/&gt;Group Policy and security templates
&lt;li/&gt;Running secure code
&lt;li/&gt;Authentication
&lt;li/&gt;IP security
&lt;li/&gt;Public Key Certificates and Public Key Infrastructure
&lt;li/&gt;Smart Card technology
&lt;li/&gt;DHCP and DNS security
&lt;li/&gt;Internet Information Services security
&lt;li/&gt;Active Directory security
&lt;li/&gt;Remote access security
&lt;li/&gt;Security audits
&lt;li/&gt;Sending secure email, and more&lt;/ul&gt;
Many chapters include a debate, in which fictional protagonists discuss the pros and cons of a particular strategy or solution. These debates provide an objective look at competing methodologies, so you can select the solutions that best fit your network. Read this book cover to cover to create and implement a security plan, or use individual chapters as stand-alone lessons. Either way, &lt;i&gt;Securing Windows Server 2003&lt;/i&gt; will guide you safely through the morass of security threats. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRC (Internet Relay Chat) may very well turn out to be the world's most successful hack.  In  1988, Jarkko Oikarinen wrote the original IRC program at the University of Oulu, Finland.  As he says in his foreword,  "IRC started as one summer trainee's programming exercise. A hack grew into a software development project that hundreds of people participated in, and then became a worldwide environment where tens of thousands of people now spend time with each other. I have found many of my friends through IRC and learnt a significant part of my present software engineering knowledge while using and working with IRC. That would not have been possible without learning from code examples and hacks from others".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRC has continued to grow in popularity since its inception.  Millions of people from all over the world now use IRC to chat with friends, discuss projects and collaborate on research. With a simple, clearly defined protocol, IRC has become one of the most accessible chat environments, with clients written for a multitude of operating systems. And IRC is more than just a simple chat system it is a network of intercommunicating servers, allowing thousands of clients to connect from anywhere in the world using the IRC protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While IRC is easy to get into and many people are happy to use it without being aware of what's happening under the hood, there are those who hunger for more knowledge, and this book is for them.  &lt;i&gt;IRC Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of tips and tools that cover just about everything needed to become a true IRC master, featuring contributions from some of the most renowned IRC hackers, many of whom collaborated on IRC, grouping together to form the channel #irchacks on the freenode IRC network (irc.freenode.net).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all of our Hacks books, there are many different ways to use &lt;i&gt;IRC Hacks&lt;/i&gt;.  You can read the book from cover to cover, but you might be better served by picking an interesting item from the table of contents and just diving in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're relatively new to IRC, you should considering starting with a few hacks from each progressive chapter. Chapter 1 starts you off by showing you how to connect to IRC, while Chapter 2 acquaints you with the everyday concepts you'll need to use IRC effectively. Chapter 3 is all about users and channels, and introduces the first pieces of code. Chapter 4 shows you how to make useful enhancements to IRC clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 5 is where you will learn the basics about creating IRC bots, with Chapters 6-12 introducing more complex bots that can be used for logging, servicing communities, searching, announcing, networking, managing channels or simply for having fun. Chapter 13 delves into the IRC protocol in more detail, and Chapter 14 demonstrates some interesting alternative methods for connecting to IRC. Finally, Chapter 15 will move you on to new pastures by showing you how to set up your own IRC server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book presents an opportunity to learn how IRC works and how to make best use of some of the features that have made it the most successful, most scalable, and most mature chat system on this planet. &lt;i&gt;IRC Hacks&lt;/i&gt; delves deep into the possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unit test frameworks are a key element of popular development methodologies such as eXtreme Programming (XP) and Agile Development. But unit testing has moved far beyond eXtreme Programming; it is now common in many different types of application development. Unit tests help ensure low-level code correctness, reduce software development cycle time, improve developer productivity, and produce more robust software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, there was little documentation available on unit testing, and most sources addressed specific frameworks and specific languages, rather than explaining the use of unit testing as a language-independent, standalone development methodology. This invaluable new book covers the theory and background of unit test frameworks, offers step-by-step instruction in basic unit test development, provides useful code examples in both Java and C++, and includes details on some of the most commonly used frameworks today from the XUnit family, including JUnit for Java, CppUnit for C++, and NUnit for .NET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unit Test Frameworks&lt;/i&gt; includes clear, concise, and detailed descriptions of:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The theory and design of unit test frameworks

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe the sky really is the limit when it comes to creating unparalleled user experiences and applications for the Web--then Macromedia Flash MX is sure to be your tool of choice. With Flash, you can integrate video, text, audio, and graphics into distinctive and compelling web content, stunningly interactive and expressive user interfaces, and rich applications for the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash is all about helping you dramatically enhance the user experience. And &lt;i&gt;Flash Out of the Box&lt;/i&gt; is all about helping you think outside of the box to get there--first, by diving into the Flash box and then becoming intimately acquainted with every nook and cranny of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Flash Out of the Box&lt;/i&gt;, you'll follow and work with a simple box through a "day in the life" style journey. You'll study, use, abuse, and transform the box as you move through exercises that teach you the basics of Flash, and much more, in an entertaining, unforgettable, task-oriented fashion. You'll learn to animate, work with video, load external assets, draw, mask, modularize, and many other things that will be essential as you move into more advanced techniques with other books.  It's just you, Flash, and the box, mastering each technique along the way and adding others in a fashion that will let you practice and learn simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Flash tutorials you've looked at are tool-centric, focusing on Flash's individual features and how to use them (an approach that can quickly become tedious), whereas this innovative, engaging, and motivating book is uniquely user-centric. That means it concentrates on you and what you want and need to learn. Each successive lesson anticipates and builds upon your needs, capabilities, and questions as you evolve from Flash beginner to Flash master. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in a fun and conversational tone, the highly accessible &lt;i&gt;Flash Out of the Box&lt;/i&gt; makes learning Flash MX 2004 intuitive, logical, and, most of all, fun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Database experts may enjoy fiddling with SQL, but you don't have to--the rest of the application is the fun part. And even database experts dread the tedious plumbing and typographical spaghetti needed to put their SQL into a Java program. &lt;i&gt;Hibernate: A Developers Notebook&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to use Hibernate to automate persistence: you write natural Java objects and some simple configuration files, and Hibernate automates all the interaction between your objects and the database.  You don't even need to know the database is there, and you can change from one database to another simply by changing a few statements in a configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; walks you through the ins and outs of using Hibernate, from installation and configuration, to complex associations and composite types. Two chapters explore ways to write sophisticated queries, which you can express either through a pure Java API, or with an SQL-inspired, but object-oriented, query language. Don't let that intimidate you though: one of the biggest surprises in working with Hibernate is that for many of the common real-world application scenarios, you don't need an explicit query at all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've needed to add a database backend to your application, don't put it off.  It's much more fun than it used to be, and &lt;i&gt;Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; shows you why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what a few reviewers had to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm sitting on an airplane after finishing &lt;i&gt;Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt;.  It's rare to find a book on a new Java technology that you can get through on a domestic flight.  That this notebook effectively and succinctly tackles object-relational mapping makes it, and Hibernate, even more impressive.  Many books in this category would need to be checked luggage.  With this book, you travel first class." --Mike Clark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A simple persistence framework deserves a simple book, and this one delivers. The examples are well described and easy to understand, yet sophisticated enough to demonstrate Hibernate in a real-world context. Jim, I'm a new fan."  --Bruce Tate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the new Developer's Notebook Series from O'Reilly:
Developer's Notebooks are a new book series covering important new tools for software developers.  Developer's Notebooks stress example over explanation and practice over theory. They are about learning by doing; by experimenting with tools and discovering what works.  "All lab, no lecture," with a thoughtful lab partner to guide the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to use Hibernate to automate persistence: you write natural Java objects and some simple configuration files, and Hibernate automates all the interaction between your objects and the database.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning a language--any language--involves a process wherein you learn to rely less and less on instruction and more increasingly on the aspects of the language you've mastered. Whether you're learning French, Java, or C, at some point you'll set aside the tutorial and attempt to converse on your own. It's not necessary to know every subtle facet of French in order to speak it well, especially if there's a good dictionary available. Likewise, C programmers don't need to memorize every detail of C in order to write good programs. What they need instead is a reliable, comprehensive reference that they can keep nearby. &lt;i&gt;C in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is that reference.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This long-awaited book is a complete reference to the C programming language and C runtime library. Its purpose is to serve as a convenient, reliable companion in your day-to-day work as a C programmer.  C in a Nutshell covers virtually everything you need to program in C, describing all the elements of the language and illustrating their use with numerous examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The book is divided into three distinct parts.  The first part is a fast-paced description, reminiscent of the classic Kernighan &amp;amp; Ritchie text on which many C programmers cut their teeth.  It focuses specifically on the C language and preprocessor directives, including extensions introduced to the ANSI standard in 1999.  These topics and others are covered: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numeric constants
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implicit and explicit type conversions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expressions and operators
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fixed-length and variable-length arrays
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pointers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dynamic memory management
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Input and output&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of the book is a comprehensive reference to the C runtime library; it includes an overview of the contents of the standard headers and a description of each standard library function.  Part III provides the necessary knowledge of the C programmer's basic tools: the compiler, the make utility, and the debugger.  The tools described here are those in the GNU software collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;C in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the perfect companion to K&amp;amp;R, and destined to be the most reached-for reference on your desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Covering the C programming language and C runtime library, this book is destined to be a constant companion in your work. &lt;i&gt;C in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; covers virtually everything you need to program in C.  Topics include runtime library calls, common compiler options, and questions of C syntax and usage.  Not to be missed by C programmers of all levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the dawn of creation, man has designed maps to help identify the space that we occupy.  From Lewis and Clark's pencil-sketched maps of mountain trails to Jacques Cousteau's sophisticated charts of the ocean floor, creating maps of the utmost precision has been a constant pursuit.  So why should things change now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, they shouldn't.  The reality is that map creation, or "cartography," has only improved in its ease-of-use over time.  In fact, with the recent explosion of inexpensive computing and the growing availability of public mapping data, mapmaking today extends all the way to the ordinary PC user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mapping Hacks&lt;/i&gt;, the latest page-turner from O'Reilly Press, tackles this notion head on.  It's a collection of one hundred simple--and mostly free--techniques available to developers and power users who want draw digital maps or otherwise visualize geographic data.  Authors Schuyler Erle, Rich Gibson, and Jo Walsh do more than just illuminate the basic concepts of location and cartography, they walk you through the process one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mapping Hacks&lt;/i&gt; shows you where to find the best sources of geographic data, and then how to integrate that data into your own map.  But that's just an appetizer.  This comprehensive resource also shows you how to interpret and manipulate unwieldy cartography data, as well as how to incorporate personal photo galleries into your maps.  It even provides practical uses for GPS (Global Positioning System) devices--those touch-of-a-button street maps integrated into cars and mobile phones.  Just imagine: If Captain Kidd had this technology, we'd all know where to find his buried treasure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these industrial-strength tips and tools, &lt;i&gt;Mapping Hacks&lt;/i&gt; effectively takes the sting out of the digital mapmaking and navigational process.  Now you can create your own maps for business, pleasure, or entertainment--without ever having to sharpen a single pencil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annoyance factor for individual users whose email is crammed with pitches for pornography, absurd moneymaking schemes, and dubious health products is fierce. But for organizations, the cost of spam in lost productivity and burned bandwidth is astronomical. While society is grappling with a solution to the burgeoning crisis of spam proliferation, the pressure is on system administrators to find a solution to this massive problem in-house. And fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sys admins can field scores of complaints and spend months testing software suites that turn out to be too aggressive, too passive, or too complicated to setup only to discover that SpamAssassin (SA), the leading open source spam-fighting tool, is free, flexible, powerful,  highly-regarded, and remarkably effective. The drawback?  SpamAssassin's lack of published documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SpamAssassin&lt;/i&gt; by Alan Schwartz, is the only published resource devoted to SpamAssassin and how to integrate it effectively into your networks. This clear, concise guide clarifies the installation, configuration, and use of the SpamAssassin spam-checking system (versions 2.63 and 3.0) for Unix system administrators using the Postfix, Sendmail, Exim, or qmail mail servers, helping administrators make the right integration decision for their particular environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It covers concrete advice on how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Customize SpamAssassin's rules, and even create new ones Train SpamAssassin's Bayesian classifier, a statistical engine for detecting spam, to optimize it for the sort of email that you typically receive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block specific addresses, hosts, and domains using third-party blacklists like the one maintained by Spamcop.net.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whitelist known good sources of email, so that messages from clients, coworkers, and friends aren't inadvertently lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure SpamAssassin to work with newer spam-filtering methods such as Hashcash (www.hashcash.org) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Sys admins, network administrators, and ISPs pay for spam with hours of experimentation and tedious junk email management, frayed user tempers, and their sanity. SpamAssassin, together with this essential book, give you the tools you need to take back your organization's inboxes.
&lt;p&gt;"Detailed, accurate and informative--recommended for spam-filtering beginners and experts alike." --Justin Mason, SpamAssassin development team &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Modding Mac OS X&lt;/i&gt; isn't about cutting up your Power Mac's case with a saws-all; it's about modifying Mac OS X's user interface and unlocking secrets and dispelling your fears of the Unix command line so you can take command of your Mac.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Modding Mac OS X&lt;/i&gt; starts out with the very basics of showing you how to configure your Mac and do simple things like change Finder views, use an image from iPhoto's library on your desktop, and how to find and use screen savers. From there, &lt;i&gt;Modding Mac OS X&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find hidden features in your favorite applications
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dive inside application bundles to find hidden resources
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change application and system-wide keyboard shortcuts
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with the Property List Editor to read and edit property list files
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wrap your head around the defaults command to tweak an application's settings
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hack on NIB files to change an application's interface
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control an application with AppleScript, even if it isn't scriptable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Each Modding example includes detailed step-by-step instructions that even a novice Mac user can follow, while also providing the necessary detail to satisfy the experienced hacker. The knowledge you gain from tweaking one application can be easily applied to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So go on, empower your inner Mac geek. You know you want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book uncovers dozens of ways to customize the user interface for both Mac OS X and its applications, using the newest tools; from hacking the preferences, enabling and disabling plug-ins, to using the Terminal and applications like the Property List Editor to tweak files and edit resources. If you're ready to tweak and experiment, to create and refine, to customize and control OSX and your applications and have some fun doing it--this is an indispensable guide. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You've probably heard the buzz about Eclipse, the powerful open source platform that gives Java developers a new way to approach development projects. It's like a shiny new car--no longer content to just admire Eclipse, you're now itching to get in and drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eclipse is to Java developers what Visual Studio is to .NET developers--it's an integrated development environment (IDE) that combines a code editor, compiler, debugger, text editor, graphical user interface (GUI) builder, and other components into a single, user-friendly application. It provides a solid foundation that enables Java developers to construct and run integrated software-development tools for web development, application design, modeling, performance, testing, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any extensive programming tool, however, there's a lot to learn. And there s no better guy than well-known Java expert Steve Holzner to teach you. An award-winning and best-selling author who has been writing about Java topics since the language first appeared, Holzner delivers just the kind of targeted, practical, everyday knowledge you need to hone your mastery of Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect as a companion to an Eclipse programming tutorial (such as Holzner's own &lt;a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/eclipse/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, O'Reilly, April 2004) or an ideal stand-alone for all those developers who either don't want or don't need the tutorial approach, the &lt;i&gt;Eclipse Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; contains task-oriented recipes for more than 800 situations you may encounter while using this new Java platform--from deploying a web application automatically to reverse engineering compiled code, from re-naming all references to a class across multiple packages to initializing the SWT JNI libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each recipe in the ever-popular and utterly practical problem-solution-discussion format for O'Reilly cookbooks contains a clear and thorough description of the problem, a brief but complete discussion of a solution, and in-action examples illustrating that solution. The &lt;i&gt;Eclipse Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; will satiate Java programmers at all levels who are ready to go beyond tutorials--far beyond writing plug-ins and extensions--and actually use the powerful and convenient Eclipse day to day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Eclipse is a powerful open source platform that gives Java developers a new way to approach development projects. In the &lt;i&gt;Eclipse Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, Java expert Steve Holzner demystifies Eclipse with practical recipes for more than 800 situations you may encounter--from deploying a web application automatically to reverse engineering compiled code, from re-naming all references to a class across multiple packages to initializing the SWT JNI libraries. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Head First Design Patterns</title>

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;You're not alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who've faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on...something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don't just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look "in the wild". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java's built-in pattern support in your own code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead).  You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you're up a creek without a design pattern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Most importantly, you want to learn the "secret language" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You'll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn't as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With &lt;i&gt;Head First Design Patterns&lt;/i&gt;, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the "Trading Spaces" show. Best of all, in a way that won't put you to sleep!  We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, &lt;i&gt;Head First Design Patterns&lt;/i&gt; will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks. In a way that lets you put them to work immediately. In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating a personal computer requires more than just dealing with the PC itself.  As anyone with even a modicum of computer experience can attest, there are all types of hardware devices which you must become familiar with disk drives, printers, monitors, and sound cards, just to name a few.  And, naturally, each is fraught with its own set of bugs and snares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;PC Hardware Annoyances&lt;/i&gt;, the latest installment of O'Reilly's highly successful Annoyances series, aims to optimize these peripheral systems by offering easy fixes to their most annoying traits. With over 40 titles to his credit, author Stephen Bigelow identifies all those annoyances that make you cringe in frustration. Then, through the use of snappy, entertaining, and practical solutions, he shows you how to clear each obstacle one step at a time.  After that, the rest is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed for PC users of all levels, this handy guide doesn't bore you with long dissertations on the workings of the technology at hand.  Instead, it offers straightforward, easy-to-understand troubleshooting solutions.  For maximum ease of use, &lt;i&gt;PC Hardware Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; is broken up into several broad hardware categories.  They include desktops, laptops and PDAs, graphics, sound, hard drives, CD/DVD drives, network, and printers and scanners.  And while you may not use each of these accessories currently, chances are it's only a matter of time before you'll need their technological services whether it's for work or recreation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes &lt;i&gt;PC Hardware Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; especially timely is the growing trend among computer owners to simply upgrade their PCs as they age, rather than replacing them altogether.  With peripheral devices becoming increasingly affordable, there's no reason not to.  But as with any do-it-yourself project, trouble lurks around the corner if you don't have the right guide.  Having difficulty setting up your color inkjet printer?  Trying to burn a music CD?  Is your modem misbehaving?  The remedy: &lt;i&gt;PC Hardware Annoyances&lt;/i&gt;, of course! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

      <subject>Operating Systems</subject>
      <subject>Linux</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intensive search for a more secure operating system has often left everyday, production computers far behind their experimental, research cousins. Now SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) dramatically changes this.  This best-known and most respected security-related extension to Linux embodies the key advances of the security field.  Better yet, SELinux is available in widespread and popular distributions of the Linux operating system--including for Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and SUSE--all of it free and open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SELinux emerged from research by the National Security Agency and implements classic strong-security measures such as role-based access controls, mandatory access controls, and fine-grained transitions and privilege escalation following the principle of least privilege. It compensates for the inevitable buffer overflows and other weaknesses in applications by isolating them and preventing flaws in one application from spreading to others. The scenarios that cause the most cyber-damage these days--when someone gets a toe-hold on a computer through a vulnerability in a local networked application, such as a Web server, and parlays that toe-hold into pervasive control over the computer system--are prevented on a properly administered SELinux system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key, of course, lies in the words "properly administered." A system administrator for SELinux needs a wide range of knowledge, such as the principles behind the system, how to assign different privileges to different groups of users, how to change policies to accommodate new software, and how to log and track what is going on. And this is where SELinux is invaluable. Author Bill McCarty, a security consultant who has briefed numerous government agencies, incorporates his intensive research into SELinux into this small but information-packed book. Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A readable and concrete explanation of SELinux concepts and the SELinux security model
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installation instructions for numerous distributions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic system and user administration
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A detailed dissection of the SELinux policy language
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examples and guidelines for altering and adding policies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
With &lt;i&gt;SELinux&lt;/i&gt;, a high-security computer is within reach of any system administrator. If you want an effective means of securing your Linux system--and who doesn't?--this book provides the means. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This small but information-packed book covers the wide range of knowledge needed to secure your system using this respected extension to Linux. &lt;i&gt;SELinux&lt;/i&gt; discusses critical topics, such as SELinux concepts and its security model; installation instructions; system and user administration; understanding, implementing, and developing your own SELinux security policies. With &lt;i&gt;SELinux&lt;/i&gt;, a high-security computer is within reach of any system administrator, and this book provides the means. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask network administrators what their most critical computer application is, and most will say "email" without a moment's hesitation. If you run a network powered by Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Exchange occupies much of your time. According to Microsoft, 110 million Exchange seats have been deployed, but 60% of you are still running Exchange 5.5. That's a problem, because the difference between version 5.5 and the more efficient Exchange 2000 and Exchange Server 2003 is profound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't fret. &lt;i&gt;Exchange Server Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; offers you a comprehensive how-to guide to these newer versions of Exchange. You'll find quick solutions for the most common tasks you need to perform--everything from installation and maintenance to configuration and optimization, with proven recipes for the most useful tools and utilities. The book also has solutions to some uncommon tasks (that you may not know are possible) and advanced procedures that aren't part of day-to-day operations. These include tasks for critical situations, such as using a recovery storage group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our reliable desktop reference even shows you how to write scripts for Exchange management and deployment tasks. That's right. While not every Exchange job can be scripted, many can, and we provide lots of working VBScript examples for accomplishing particular goals. Whatever your particular need, you'll find it quickly, because chapters in this Cookbook are laid out by recipe, with cross references to other pertinent solutions in the book. With this guide, you'll learn:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relationship between Exchange and Active Directory
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When to use the GUI, the command line, or scripting
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to prepare forests, domains, and servers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to use Group Policy to control Exchange
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagnostic logging, measure performance, and administrative privileges
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recipient management: user accounts, mailboxes, mail-enabled groups
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mailbox and public folder database management
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Message routing and transport functions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security, backup, restore, and recovery operations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
For every question you have about Exchange 2000 or Exchange Server 2003, our Cookbook has the answer--one that you can find and implement without a moment's hesitation. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;If you run a network powered by Windows, Microsoft Exchange occupies much of your time. Our new Cookbook offers you a comprehensive how-to guide to the most common tasks for both Exchange 2000 and Exchange Server 2003--everything from installation and maintenance to configuration and optimization. You'll also find solutions to uncommon tasks, advanced procedures, and ways to write scripts for Exchange management and deployment tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the animal it's named for, Mac OS X Panther is beautiful, sleek, superbly efficient, dangerously alluring, and all muscle under the surface. Beneath its appealing interface, it's a hard-working machine. Those coming to Mac OS X from previous incarnations of the operating system recognize much of the friendly face of the Macintosh they're used to, but they're also plunged into a whole new world. Unix converts to Mac OS X find a familiar FreeBSD-like operating system at the core and many of the command-line applications that they're familiar with: it's like an open invitation to roll up their sleeves and hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mac OS X Panther Hacks&lt;/i&gt; brings together the perfect combination of tips, tricks, and tools to help serious Mac users--regardless of their background--get the most from their machines.  This revised collection reflects the real-world know how of those well-steeped in Unix history and expertise, sharing their no-nonsense, sometimes quick-and-dirty solutions to administering and taking full advantage of everything a Unix desktop has to offer: Web, Mail, and FTP serving, security services, SSH, Perl and shell scripting, compiling, configuring, scheduling, networking, and hacking.  Add to that the experience of die-hard Macintosh users, customizing and modifying their hardware and software to meet their needs.  The end result is cool stuff no power user should be without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hacks in the book range from the quick and easy to the more complex. Each can be read easily in a few minutes, saving countless hours of searching for the right answer. &lt;i&gt;Mac OS X Panther Hacks&lt;/i&gt; provides direct, hands-on solutions in topics such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;User Interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessories (iPod, USB devices, mobile phones, PDAs, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wired and wireless networking (Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email (servers and clients)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web (servers and clients)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging (iChat and associated apps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Printing and Faxing (sharing printers, fax server, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multimedia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If you want more than your average Mac user--you want to explore and experiment, unearth shortcuts, create useful tools, and come up with fun things to try on your own--this book will set you on the right track.  Written for users who need to go beyond what's covered in conventional manuals--&lt;i&gt;Mac OS X Panther Hacks&lt;/i&gt; will bring your Mac to its full potential. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;There was a time, not too long ago, when the typewriter and notebook ruled, and the computer as an everyday tool was simply a vision. Revolution in the Valley traces this vision back to its earliest roots: the hallways and backrooms of Apple, where the groundbreaking Macintosh computer was born. The book traces the development of the Macintosh, from its inception as an underground skunkworks project in 1979 to its triumphant introduction in 1984 and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The stories in &lt;i&gt;Revolution in the Valley&lt;/i&gt; come on extremely good authority. That's because author Andy Hertzfeld was a core member of the team that built the Macintosh system software, and a key creator of the Mac's radically new user interface software. One of the chosen few who worked with the mercurial Steve Jobs, you might call him the ultimate insider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
When &lt;i&gt;Revolution in the Valley&lt;/i&gt; begins, Hertzfeld is working on Apple's first attempt at a low-cost, consumer-oriented computer: the Apple II. He sees that Steve Jobs is luring some of the company's most brilliant innovators to work on a tiny research effort the Macintosh. Hertzfeld manages to make his way onto the Macintosh research team, and the rest is history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Through lavish illustrations, period photos, and Hertzfeld's vivid first-hand accounts, Revolution in the Valley reveals what it was like to be there at the birth of the personal computer revolution. The story comes to life through the book's portrait of the talented and often eccentric characters who made up the Macintosh team. Now, over 20 years later, millions of people are benefiting from the technical achievements of this determined and brilliant group of people.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much of what is commonplace today was once considered impossible, or at least wishful thinking. Laser beams in the operating room, cars with built-in guidance systems, cell phones with email access.  There's just no getting around the fact that technology always has, and always will be, very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But technology isn't only cool; it's also very smart. That's why one of the hottest technological trends nowadays is the creation of  smart homes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an increasing rate, people are turning their homes into state-of-the-art machines, complete with more switches, sensors, and actuators than you can shake a stick at.  Whether you want to equip your home with motion detectors for added security, install computer-controlled lights for optimum convenience, or even mount an in-home web cam or two purely for entertainment, the world is now your oyster.  Ah, but like anything highly technical, creating a smart home is typically easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, &lt;i&gt;Smart Home Hacks&lt;/i&gt; takes the guesswork out of the process.  Through a seemingly unending array of valuable tips, tools, and techniques, &lt;i&gt;Smart Home Hacks&lt;/i&gt; explains in clear detail how to use Mac, Windows, or Linux to achieve the automated home of your dreams.  In no time, you'll learn how to turn a loose collection of sensors and switches into a well-automated and well-functioning home no matter what your technical level may be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Smart Home Hacks&lt;/i&gt; covers a litany of stand-alone and integrated smart home solutions designed to enhance safety, comfort, and convenience in new and existing homes.  Kitchens, bedrooms, home offices, living rooms, and even bathrooms are all candidates for smart automation and therefore are all addressed in &lt;i&gt;Smart Home Hacks&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 67% of web servers running Apache, it is by far the most widely used web server platform in the world.  Apache has evolved into a powerful system that easily rivals other HTTP servers in terms of functionality, efficiency, and speed.  Despite these impressive capabilities, though, Apache is only a beneficial tool if it's a secure one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, administrators installing and configuring Apache still need a sure-fire way to secure it--whether it's running a huge e-commerce operation, corporate intranet, or just a small hobby site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our new guide, &lt;i&gt;Apache Security&lt;/i&gt;, gives administrators and webmasters just what they crave--a comprehensive security source for Apache.  Successfully combining Apache administration and web security topics, &lt;i&gt;Apache Security&lt;/i&gt; speaks to nearly everyone in the field.  What's more, it offers a concise introduction to the theory of securing Apache, as well as a broad perspective on server security in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this book isn't just about theory.  The real strength of &lt;i&gt;Apache Security&lt;/i&gt; lies in its wealth of interesting and practical advice, with many real-life examples and solutions.  Administrators and programmers will learn how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;install and configure Apache
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;prevent denial of service (DoS) and other attacks
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;securely share servers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;control logging and monitoring
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;secure custom-written web applications
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;conduct a web security assessment
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;use mod_security and other security-related modules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
And that's just the tip of the iceberg, as mainstream Apache users will also gain valuable information on PHP and SSL/ TLS.  Clearly, &lt;i&gt;Apache Security&lt;/i&gt; is packed and to the point, with plenty of details for locking down this extremely popular and versatile web server. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This all-purpose guide for locking down Apache arms readers with all the information they need to securely deploy applications.  Administrators and programmers alike will benefit from a concise introduction to the theory of securing Apache, plus a wealth of practical advice and real-life examples.  Topics covered include installation, server sharing, logging and monitoring, web applications, PHP and SSL/TLS, and more. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, Windows XP is pre-installed on 30 million PCs sold in the U.S.--and 90 million worldwide--making it the world's most popular operating system, and proving to frustrated users everywhere that preponderance does not equate to ease of use. There are literally thousands of programs, tools, commands, screens, scripts, buttons, tabs, applets, menus, and settings contained within Windows XP. And it has only been in the last couple of years that Microsoft's documentation has actually been more of a help than a hindrance. But it still isn't enough.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Windows XP users and administrators need a quick and easy way to find answers. Plenty of books go into detail about the theory behind a particular technology or application, but few go straight to the essentials for getting the job done. &lt;i&gt;Windows XP Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; does just that, tackling the most common tasks needed to install, manage, and support Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Featuring a new twist to O'Reilly's proven Cookbook formula, this problem-solving guide offers multiple solutions for each of its 300-plus recipes. Solve dilemmas with the graphical user interface, the command line, through the Registry, or by using scripts.  Each step-by-step recipe includes a discussion that explains how and why it works.  The book is also among the first to cover Microsoft's XP Service Pack 2. With these practical,  on-the-job solutions, &lt;i&gt;Windows XP Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; will save you hours of time searching for answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Windows XP Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; will be useful to anyone that has to use, deploy, administer, or automate Windows XP. But this isn't a typical end-user book; it covers the spectrum of topics involved with running Windows XP in both small and large environments. As a result, IT professionals and system administrators will find it a great day-to-day reference. And power users will find &lt;i&gt;Windows XP Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; a great source for information on tweaking XP and getting the most out of their systems. The bottom line is that &lt;i&gt;Windows XP Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; will make just about anyone who uses XP more productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Designed for all levels of IT professionals and power users, this handy reference guide provides practical solutions for the most common Windows XP tasks.  These step-by-step recipes allow you to install, manage, and support your operating system with ease.  Also covers Microsoft's XP Service Pack 2.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft introduced the Visual Basic .NET programming language, as part of its move to the .NET Framework two years ago, many developers willingly made the switch. Millions of others, however, continued to stick with Visual Basic 6. They weren't ready for such a radical change, which included an object-oriented environment similar to Java. They liked the old Visual Basic just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to win over those diehard VB6 developers, the company has included a new version of VB.NET in its upcoming  next generation  release of the Visual Studio .NET development platform. Visual Basic 2005 comes with innovative language constructs, new compiler features, dramatically enhanced productivity and an improved debugging experience. The language's new version is now available in beta release, and Microsoft is encouraging developers to give it a test drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Visual Basic 2005: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; provides the ideal test track. With nearly 50 hands-on projects, this practical introduction to VB 2005 will bring you up to speed on all the new features of this language by allowing you to work with them directly. The book summarizes the changes that VB 2005 brings, and tells you how to acquire, install and configure the beta version of VB 2005 SDK. Each project or experiment explores a different feature, with emphasis on changes that can increase productivity, simplify programming tasks, and help you add new functionality to your applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one-of-a-kind book also offers suggestions for further experimentation, links to on-line documentation and other sources of information, and practical notes and warnings from the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly offers an in-depth first look at important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style. For those who want to get up speed with VB 2005 right away, this is the perfect  all lab, no lecture  guide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language for generating, manipulating, and retrieving information from a relational database.  If you're working with a relational database--whether you're writing applications, performing administrative tasks, or generating reports--you need to know how to interact with your data. Even if you are using a tool that generates SQL for you, such as a reporting tool, there may still be cases where you need to bypass the automatic generation feature and write your own SQL statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To help you attain this fundamental SQL knowledge, look to &lt;i&gt;Learning SQL&lt;/i&gt;, an introductory guide to SQL, designed primarily for developers just cutting their teeth on the language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Learning SQL&lt;/i&gt; moves you quickly through the basics and then on to some of the more commonly used advanced features.  Among the topics discussed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The history of the computerized database
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQL Data Statements--those used to create, manipulate, and retrieve data stored in your database; example statements include select, update, insert, and delete
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SQL Schema Statements--those used to create database objects, such as tables, indexes, and constraints
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How data sets can interact with queries
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The importance of subqueries
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data conversion and manipulation via SQL's built-in functions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How conditional logic can be used in Data Statements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Best of all, &lt;i&gt;Learning SQL&lt;/i&gt; talks to you in a real-world manner, discussing various platform differences that you're likely to encounter and offering a series of chapter exercises that walk you through the learning process.  Whenever possible, the book sticks to the features included in the ANSI SQL standards.  This means you'll be able to apply what you learn to any of several different databases; the book covers MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database, but the features and syntax should apply just as well (perhaps with some tweaking) to IBM DB2, Sybase Adaptive Server, and PostgreSQL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Put the power and flexibility of SQL to work. With &lt;i&gt;Learning SQL&lt;/i&gt; you can master this important skill and know that the SQL statements you write are indeed correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This introductory guide gets you up and running on SQL in short order.  A series of helpful chapter exercises teaches you how to generate, manipulate, and retrieve the data stored in your organization's database.  Ideal for anyone writing applications, performing administrative tasks, or generating reports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than sixty percent of today's email traffic is spam, according to email filtering firm Brightmail. This year alone, five trillion spam messages will clog Internet users in-boxes, costing society an estimated $10-billion in lost productivity, filtering software, and other expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spam Kings: The Real Story behind the High-Rolling Hucksters Pushing Porn, Pills, and %*@)# Enlargements&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to expose the shadowy world of the people responsible for the junk email problem. Author and veteran investigative journalist Brian S. McWilliams delivers a compelling account of the cat-and-mouse game played by spam entrepreneurs in search of easy fortunes and those who are trying to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spam Kings&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the evolution of Davis Wolfgang Hawke, a notorious neo-Nazi leader (Jewish-born) who got into junk email in 1999. Using Hawke as a case study, &lt;i&gt;Spam Kings&lt;/i&gt; traces the twenty-year-old neophyte's rise in the spam trade to his emergence as a major player in the lucrative penis pill market--a business that would eventually make him a millionaire and the target of lawsuits from AOL and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spam Kings&lt;/i&gt; also tells the parallel story of Susan Gunn, a computer novice in California who is reluctantly drawn into the spam wars and eventually joins a group of anti-spam activists. Her volunteer sleuth work puts her on a collision course with Hawke and other spammers, who try to wreak revenge on the antis. You'll also meet other cyber-vigilantes who have taken up the fight against spammers as well as the cast of quirky characters who comprise Hawke's business associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book sheds light on the technical sleight-of-hand--forged headers, open relays, harvesting tools, and bulletproof hosting--and other sleazy business practices that spammers use; the work of top anti-spam attorneys; the surprising new partnership developing between spammers and computer hackers; and the rise of a new breed of computer viruses designed to turn the PCs of innocent bystanders into secret spam factories.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The mounting onslaught of email pitches for porn, pills, and penis enlargement has some techno-pundits declaring that spam is on the verge of destroying the Internet. In &lt;i&gt;Spam Kings&lt;/i&gt;, author and veteran investigative journalist Brian S. McWilliams delivers a compelling account of the cat-and-mouse game played by spam entrepreneurs (including the notorious Davis Wolfgang Hawke, "Dr. Fatburn," and Scott Richter) in search of easy fortunes and the cyber-vigilantes who are trying to stop them. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consisting of a number of well-known open source products, JBoss is more a family of interrelated services than a single monolithic application.  But, as with any tool that's as feature-rich as JBoss, there are number of pitfalls and complexities, too.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Most developers struggle with the same issues when deploying J2EE applications on JBoss: they have trouble getting the many J2EE and JBoss deployment descriptors to work together; they have difficulty finding out how to get started; their projects don't have a packaging and deployment strategy that grows with the application; or, they find the Class Loaders confusing and don't know how to use them, which can cause problems.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;JBoss at Work: A Practical Guide&lt;/i&gt; helps developers overcome these challenges. As you work through the book, you'll build a project using extensive code examples.  You'll delve into all the major facets of J2EE application deployment on JBoss, including JSPs, Servlets, EJBs, JMS, JNDI, web services, JavaMail, JDBC, and Hibernate. With the help of this book, you'll:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement a full J2EE application and deploy it on JBoss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover how to use the latest features of JBoss 4 and J2EE 1.4, including J2EE-compliant web services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master J2EE application deployment on JBoss with EARs, WARs, and EJB JARs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the core J2EE deployment descriptors and how they integrate with JBoss-specific descriptors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base your security strategy on JAAS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written for Java developers who want to use JBoss on their projects, the book covers the gamut of deploying J2EE technologies on JBoss, providing a brief survey of each subject aimed at the working professional with limited time.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you're one of the legions of developers who have decided to give JBoss a try, then &lt;i&gt;JBoss at Work: A Practical Guide&lt;/i&gt; is your next logical purchase.  It'll show you in plain language how to use the fastest growing open source tool in the industry today. If you've worked with JBoss before, this book will get you up to speed on JBoss 4, JBoss WS (web services), and Hibernate 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This convenient guide from O'Reilly takes an in-depth look at JBoss, the fastest growing open source tool on the market.  Learn how to integrate JBoss with other open source Java products such as Tomcat and Hibernate, and much more.  Written for Java programmers who want to use JBoss on their projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as an intrepid U.S. Government initiative in the early 1970's has turned into a global way of life.  Indeed, with more than 500 million current users (and counting), the Internet has revolutionized the way societies function the world over. From dating and shopping online, to conducting informational research, to communicating via email, today seemingly everyone uses the Internet for one purpose or another.  How, then, can something so vast and powerful be defiled by something as trivial as spam?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true. The fact remains that despite the leading-edge technological sophistication fueling the Net, there are still many related annoyances that complicate and tarnish the Internet experience.  And it doesn't matter if you're a homemaker in search of a fresh chicken recipe, or a civil engineer researching plans for a new skyscraper, the problems are the same.&lt;/p&gt;

You'll learn how to make a seamless connection, thwart would-be hackers, ensure greater security while surfing, eliminate pop-up ads, maximize online services, conduct more effective Google searches, better utilize digital media (music and video), and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;i&gt;Internet Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; discusses how to design and host a personal web site something once thought of as only possible for the technically gifted. Topics like blogs, domain names, setup, HTML, fonts, and graphics and are all dissected and analyzed for easy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other books on the subject, &lt;i&gt;Internet Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; assumes readers already possess a working knowledge of the Internet.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java 5.0, code-named "Tiger", promises to be the most significant new version of Java since the introduction of the language. With over a hundred substantial changes to the core language, as well as numerous library and API additions, developers have a variety of new features, facilities, and techniques available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with so many changes, where do you start? You could read through the lengthy, often boring language specification; you could wait for the latest 500 page tome on concepts and theory; you could even play around with the new JDK, hoping you figure things out--or you can get straight to work with &lt;i&gt;Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This no-nonsense, down-and-dirty guide by bestselling Java authors Brett McLaughlin and David Flanagan skips all the boring prose and lecture, and jumps right into Tiger. You'll have a handle on the important new features of the language by the end of the first chapter, and be neck-deep in code before you hit the halfway point. Using the task-oriented format of this new series, you'll get complete practical coverage of generics, learn how boxing and unboxing affects your type conversions, understand the power of varargs, learn how to write enumerated types and annotations, master Java's new formatting methods and the for/in loop, and even get a grip on concurrency in the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light on theory and long on practical application, &lt;i&gt;Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; allows you to cut to the chase, getting straight to work with Tiger's new features. The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly covers important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing--you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style that suits developers. If you've been curious about Tiger, but haven't known where to start, this no-fluff, lab-style guide is the solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few .NET developers have the luxury of unlimited code testing once their application is complete, and rushing through the testing process is both problematic and stressful. The open source NUnit framework provides an excellent and efficient way to test and improve .NET code as it's written, saving hundreds of QA hours and headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NUnit is one of the most mature and widely-used .NET open source projects even Microsoft uses it internally. NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Written entirely in C#, NUnit takes advantage of many .NET language features, such as custom attributes and other reflection related capabilities. It automates unit testing and reduces the effort required to frequently test code while developing it. NUint is invaluable for .NET developers in test-driven development under agile methodologies such as Extreme Programming (XP) as well as for developers who use for unit testing for software quality assurance. Unfortunately, some of those valuable hours saved by using NUnit can be wasted trying to master this powerful but under-documented framework&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof that good things come in small packages, the &lt;i&gt;NUnit Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is a complete reference to NUnit, filling in the blanks left by the existing documentation and online discussion. It offers developers everything they need to know to install, configure, and use NUnit; the NUnit user interface; and a reference to the NUnit framework classes in a slim but well-organized package. This handy little book even offers practical, real world NUnit examples. And with the &lt;i&gt;NUnit Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt;, IT managers will know to expect when they implement unit testing in their projects. It is the only book you'll need on this popular and practical new open source framework. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;break a complex project into a series of smaller subprojects
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;report on code quality, unit tests, code duplication, and project activity
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;create a custom  remote repository
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;build simple and complex plug-ins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've bought or sold items through eBay, or through hundreds of other online sites, then you're familiar with PayPal, the online payment service. With PayPal, a valid email address, and a credit card or bank account, you can easily send and receive payments online. Not a bank or financial institution itself, PayPal describes its service as one that builds on the financial infrastructure of bank accounts and credit cards, and using advanced propriety fraud prevention systems, creates a safe, global, real-time payment solution.  Put simply, PayPal provides the means for people to conduct financial transactions online, instantly and securely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's more to PayPal than meets the eye. &lt;i&gt;PayPal Hacks&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to make the most of PayPal to get the most out of your online business or transactions.

Whether you're building an ecommerce site using PayPal as a transaction provider, or simply trying to pay for an eBay auction without getting burned, &lt;i&gt;PayPal Hacks&lt;/i&gt; will give you the skinny on this leading global online payment service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collection of tips and tricks in &lt;i&gt;PayPal Hacks&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to find or even build the right tools for using PayPal to buy and sell on eBay or as a transaction provider for ecommerce on your own site. Written for all PayPal users, from those just starting out to those developing sophisticated ecommerce sites, this book begins with the basics such as setting up your account, then moves quickly into specific tips and tools for buyers, sellers, and developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With PayPal Hacks, you can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn extra steps to help protect yourself while buying or selling on eBay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save time and money with advanced tips and undocumented features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn dozens of easy-to-follow procedures to help you request and receive payments and fill orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use PayPal to handle subscriptions, affiliate systems, and donations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and customize your customers' checkout process&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Java Desktop System &amp;#8482;, from Sun Microsystems, is a modern system for all kinds of users, novice through expert. As an unusually robust, well-integrated desktop system, it may become the first to fulfill the promise of mass adoption for open source.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
JDS brings Linux and other open source software up to a level of usability that makes them suitable for the enormous base of Personal Computer users including office workers, students, mobile and home users. It behaves pretty much the way a Windows or Mac user would expect, but with many more powerful features. JDS has seen widespread adoption in the United States, Britain, China, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book is the ideal guide to JDS: it is clear and direct, but loaded with insights from authors who have spent time working with, supporting, and enhancing the system. Tom Adelstein is an award winning polymath system designer; Sam Hiser is a respected business consultant with an itch that led him to become the marketing project lead for OpenOffice.org. Both are advocates for open source and founders of the Open Government Interoperability Project, members of the Open Source Software Institute and contributors to the JDShelp.org project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This book carefully covers such housekeeping chores as setting up networking, updates, and backups. Then it enters into great depth concerning the key productivity tools every user needs: email, web browsing, instant messaging, word processing, spreadsheets, and slide presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A number of chapters and appendices concerning useful tools, including things you can add to your system, rounds out this remarkably useful book. It has plenty to offer the new user as well as the seasoned Linux professional.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, security has become a hot-button issue for IT organizations of all sizes.  Accordingly, many of the security features that were either optional or suspect in Windows 2000 have become solid, effective fixtures in Windows Server 2003-making it the most secure operating system Microsoft has ever produced.  That is, if you know how to configure it properly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;i&gt;Windows Server 2003 Security Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; wants to make sure that you do know how.  Picking up right where its predecessor, the Windows Server Cookbook, left off, this desktop companion is focused solely on Windows Server security.  It teaches you how to perform important security tasks in the Windows Server 2003 OS using specific and adaptable recipes.  Each recipe features a brief description of the problem, a step-by-step solution, and then a discussion of the technology at work.  Whenever possible, the authors even tell you where to look for further information on a recipe.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The book is written in a highly modular format, with each chapter devoted to one or more technologies that Windows Server 2003 provides.  This approach allows you to look up a task or scenario that you want to accomplish, find that page, and read that particular recipe only.  Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;System preparation and administration
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protecting the computer at the TCP/IP level
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Applying security options to Active Directory
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improving security on domain controllers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing DHCP controllers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encrypting and signing network traffic using IPSec
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patch management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you're an intermediate or advanced system administrator who wants to feel secure when deploying Windows Server 2003 and its related services, then you don't want to be without the &lt;i&gt;Windows Server 2003 Security Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This handy problem-solver teaches you how to perform important security tasks in the Windows Server 2003 OS using very specific recipes.  Each recipe features a brief description of the problem, a step-by-step solution, and then a discussion of the technology at work.  Also features a detailed explanation of Microsoft's scripting support.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embedded computer systems literally surround us: they're in our cell phones, PDAs, cars, TVs, refrigerators, heating systems, and more.  In fact, embedded systems are one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer industry today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the growing list of devices for which embedded computer systems are appropriate, interest is growing among programmers, hobbyists, and engineers of all types in how to design and build devices of their own. Furthermore, the knowledge offered by this book into the fundamentals of these computer systems can benefit anyone who has to evaluate and apply the systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second edition of &lt;i&gt;Designing Embedded Hardware&lt;/i&gt; has been updated to include information on the latest generation of processors and microcontrollers, including the new MAXQ processor. If you're new to this and don't know what a MAXQ is, don't worry--the book spells out the basics of embedded design for beginners while providing material useful for advanced systems designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Designing Embedded Hardware&lt;/i&gt; steers a course between those books dedicated to writing code for particular microprocessors, and those that stress the philosophy of embedded system design without providing any practical information. Having designed 40 embedded computer systems of his own, author John Catsoulis brings a wealth of real-world experience to show readers how to design and create entirely new embedded devices and computerized gadgets, as well as how to customize and extend off-the-shelf systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loaded with real examples, this book also provides a roadmap to the pitfalls and traps to avoid. &lt;i&gt;Designing Embedded Hardware&lt;/i&gt; includes:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The theory and practice of embedded systems
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding schematics and data sheets
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Powering an embedded system
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Producing and debugging an embedded system
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Processors such as the PIC, Atmel AVR, and Motorola 68000-series
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Digital Signal Processing (DSP) architectures
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protocols (SPI and I2C) used to add peripherals
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RS-232C, RS-422, infrared communication, and USB
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CAN and Ethernet networking
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pulse Width Monitoring and motor control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If you want to build your own embedded system, or tweak an existing one, this invaluable book gives you the understanding and practical skills you need. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux's unparalleled functionality and adaptability have made it the main alternative to Unix and Microsoft Windows operating systems.  And with good reason. System administrators realize that this robust alternative can greatly improve their operating system's reliability and save them money, too.  Linux systems are even less vulnerable to attacks by computer viruses and worms. Not surprisingly, businesses, government agencies, schools, and a wealth of other institutions are all looking to Linux to replace the Windows desktop for these same benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Linux in a Windows World&lt;/i&gt; takes an in-depth look at exactly how Linux can be brought into an organization that's currently based on Microsoft Windows systems. Featuring a litany of insider tips and techniques, &lt;i&gt;Linux in a Windows World&lt;/i&gt; dispenses all the practical advice you need to migrate to this revolutionary open source software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Roderick W. Smith, himself a renowned system administrator and Linux convert, understands that the skills required to install, deploy, and maintain Linux are not easy to find. That's why he has tapped the absolute best source of information available: the Linux server experts who have made it their life's work to build and manage the Linux system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest in O'Reilly's line of bestselling Linux titles, &lt;i&gt;Linux in a Windows World&lt;/i&gt; is an invaluable companion for any system administrator interested in integrating Linux into their Windows environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The corporate market is now embracing free, "open source" software like never before, as evidenced by the recent success of the technologies underlying LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP).  Each is the result of a publicly collaborative process among numerous developers who volunteer their time and energy to create better software.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The truth is, however, that the overwhelming majority of free software projects fail.  To help you beat the odds, O'Reilly has put together &lt;i&gt;Producing Open Source Software&lt;/i&gt;, a guide that recommends tried and true steps to help free software developers work together toward a common goal.  Not just for developers who are considering starting their own free software project, this book will also help those who want to participate in the process at any level.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The book tackles this very complex topic by distilling it down into easily understandable parts.  Starting with the basics of project management, it details specific tools used in free software projects, including version control, IRC, bug tracking, and Wikis.  Author Karl Fogel, known for his work on CVS and Subversion, offers practical advice on how to set up and use a range of tools in combination with open mailing lists and archives.  He also provides several chapters on the essentials of recruiting and motivating developers, as well as how to gain much-needed publicity for your project.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
While managing a team of enthusiastic developers -- most of whom you've never even met -- can be challenging, it can also be fun.  &lt;i&gt;Producing Open Source Software&lt;/i&gt; takes this into account, too, as it speaks of the sheer pleasure to be had from working with a motivated team of free software developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive guide offers several tried and true steps to help you successfully manage the complex process of developing free software.  Topics include project management, developer motivation, technical infrastructure to support collaboration, and project promotion. &lt;i&gt;Producing Open Source Software&lt;/i&gt;  is ideal for developers starting their own free software projects, or people who simply want to participate in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be contemplating your first Linux installation. Or you may have been using Linux for years and need to know more about adding a network printer or setting up an FTP server. &lt;i&gt;Running Linux&lt;/i&gt;, now in its fifth edition, is the book you'll want on hand in either case. Widely recognized in the Linux community as the ultimate getting-started and problem-solving book, it answers the questions and tackles the configuration issues that frequently plague users, but are seldom addressed in other books.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This fifth edition of &lt;i&gt;Running Linux&lt;/i&gt; is greatly expanded, reflecting the maturity of the operating system and the teeming wealth of software available for it. Hot consumer topics such
as audio and video playback applications, groupware functionality, and spam filtering are covered, along with the basics in configuration and management that always have made the book popular.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Running Linux&lt;/i&gt; covers basic communications such as mail, web surfing, and instant messaging, but also delves into the subtleties of network configuration--including dial-up, ADSL, and cable modems--in case you need to set up your network manually. The book can
make you proficient on office suites and personal productivity applications--and also tells you what programming tools are available if you're interested in contributing to these applications.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Other new topics in the fifth edition include encrypted email and filesystems, advanced shell techniques, and remote login applications. Classic discussions on booting, package management, kernel recompilation, and X configuration have also been updated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The authors of &lt;i&gt;Running Linux&lt;/i&gt; have anticipated problem areas, selected stable and popular solutions, and provided clear instructions to ensure that you'll have a satisfying experience using Linux. The discussion is direct and complete enough to guide novice users, while still providing the additional information experienced users will need to progress in their mastery of Linux.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Whether you're using Linux on a home workstation or maintaining a network server, &lt;i&gt;Running Linux&lt;/i&gt; will provide expert advice just when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

Less a tutorial than a problem-solver, the book addresses many of the most common problems you're likely encounter--whether you've been programming in C++ for years or you're relatively new to the language.  Here are just some of the time-consuming tasks this book contains practical solutions for:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reading the contents of a directory
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating a singleton class
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Date and time parsing/arithmetic
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;String and text manipulation
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with files
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parsing XML
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using the standard containers &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Typical of O'Reilly's "Cookbook" series, &lt;i&gt;C++ Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is written in a straightforward format, featuring recipes that contain problem statements and code solutions, and apply  not to hypothetical situations, but those that you're likely to encounter. A detailed explanation then follows each recipe in order to show you how and why the solution works.  This question-solution-discussion format is a proven teaching method, as any fan of the "Cookbook" series can attest to.  This book will move quickly to the top of your list of essential C++ references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Less a tutorial than a problem-solver, this practical guide shows you how to solve many of the real-world problems that C++ developers encounter, including how to parse a date and time string and how to create a singleton class.  It's a trusted source of information for engineers, programmers, and researchers alike.  Presented in O'Reilly's classic question-solution-discussion format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a developer working with XML, you know there's a lot to know about XML, and the XML space is evolving almost moment by moment.  But you don't need to commit every XML syntax, API, or XSLT transformation to memory; you only need to know where to find it. And if it's a detail that has to do with XML or its companion standards, you'll find it--clear, concise, useful, and well-organized--in the updated third edition of &lt;i&gt;XML in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;XML in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; beside your keyboard, you'll be able to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quick-reference syntax rules and usage examples for the core XML technologies, including XML, DTDs, Xpath, XSLT, SAX, and DOM
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop an understanding of well-formed XML, DTDs, namespaces, Unicode, and W3C XML Schema
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gain a working knowledge of key technologies used for narrative XML documents such as web pages, books, and articles technologies like XSLT, Xpath, Xlink, Xpointer, CSS, and XSL-FO
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build data-intensive XML applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the tools and APIs necessary to build data-intensive XML applications and process XML documents, including the event-based Simple API for XML (SAX2) and the tree-oriented Document Object Model (DOM)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
This powerful new edition is the comprehensive XML reference. Serious users of XML will find coverage on just about everything they need, from fundamental syntax rules, to details of DTD and XML Schema creation, to XSLT transformations, to APIs used for processing XML documents. &lt;i&gt;XML in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; also covers XML 1.1, as well as updates to SAX2 and DOM Level 3 coverage. If you need explanation of how a technology works, or just need to quickly find the precise syntax for a particular piece, &lt;i&gt;XML in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; puts the information at your fingertips.
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, &lt;i&gt;XML in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the critical, must-have reference for any XML developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to know about XML, and it's constantly evolving. But you don't need to commit every syntax, API, or XSLT transformation to memory; you only need to know where to find it.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you find your way in an age of information overload? How can you filter streams of complex information to pull out only what you want? Why does it matter how information is structured when Google seems to magically bring up the right answer to your questions? What does it mean to be "findable" in this day and age?  This eye-opening new book examines the convergence of information and connectivity. Written by Peter Morville, author of the groundbreaking &lt;i&gt;Information Architecture for the World Wide Web&lt;/i&gt;, the book defines our current age as a state of unlimited findability. In other words, anyone can find anything at any time. Complete navigability.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Morville discusses the Internet, GIS, and other network technologies that are coming together to make unlimited findability possible. He explores how the melding of these innovations impacts society, since Web access is now a standard requirement for successful people and businesses. But before he does that, Morville looks back at the history of wayfinding and human evolution, suggesting that our fear of being lost has driven us to create maps, charts, and now, the mobile Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The book's central thesis is that information literacy, information architecture, and usability are all critical components of this new world order. Hand in hand with that is the contention that only by planning and designing the best possible software, devices, and Internet, will we be able to maintain this connectivity in the future. Morville's book is highlighted with full color illustrations and rich examples that bring his prose to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Ambient Findability&lt;/i&gt; doesn't preach or pretend to know all the answers. Instead, it presents research, stories, and examples in support of its novel ideas. Are we truly at a critical point in our evolution where the quality of our digital networks will dictate how we behave as a species? Is findability indeed the primary key to a successful global marketplace in the 21st century and beyond. Peter Morville takes you on a thought-provoking tour of these memes and more -- ideas that will not only fascinate but will stir your creativity in practical ways that you can apply to your work immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"A lively, enjoyable and informative tour of a topic that's only going to become more important."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--David Weinberger, Author, &lt;i&gt;Small Pieces Loosely Joined&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Cluetrain Manifesto&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"I envy the young scholar who finds this inventive book, by whatever strange means are necessary. The future isn't just unwritten--it's unsearched."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Bruce Sterling, Writer, Futurist, and Co-Founder, The Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Search engine marketing is the hottest thing in Internet business, and deservedly so. Ambient Findability puts SEM into a broader context and provides deeper insights into human behavior. This book will help you grow your online business in a world where being found is not at all certain."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Jakob Nielsen, Ph.D., Author, &lt;i&gt;Designing Web Usability: The Practice of Simplicity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Information that's hard to find will remain information that's hardly found--from one of the fathers of the discipline of information architecture, and one of its most experienced practitioners, come penetrating observations on why findability is elusive and how the act of seeking changes us."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Steve Papa, Founder and Chairman, Endeca&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Whether it's a fact or a figure, a person or a place, Peter Morville knows how to make it findable. Morville explores the possibilities of a world where everything can always be found--and the challenges in getting there--in this wide-ranging, thought-provoking book."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Jesse James Garrett, Author, &lt;i&gt;The Elements of User Experience&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"It is easy to assume that current searching of the World Wide Web is the last word in finding and using information. Peter Morville shows us that search engines are just the beginning. Skillfully weaving together information science research with his own extensive experience, he develops for the reader a feeling for the near future when information is truly findable all around us. There are immense implications, and Morville's lively and humorous writing brings them home."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Marcia J. Bates, Ph.D., University of California Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"I've always known that Peter Morville was smart. After reading Ambient Findability, I now know he's (as we say in Boston) wicked smart. This is a timely book that will have lasting effects on how we create our future.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Jared Spool, Founding Principal, User Interface Engineering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"In Ambient Findability, Peter Morville has put his mind and keyboard on the pulse of the electronic noosphere. With tangible examples and lively writing, he lays out the challenges and wonders of finding our way in cyberspace, and explains the mutually dependent evolution of our changing world and selves. This is a must read for everyone and a practical guide for designers."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Gary Marchionini, Ph.D., University of North Carolina&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"Find this book! Anyone interested in making information easier to find, or understanding how finding and being found is changing, will find this thoroughly researched, engagingly written, literate, insightful and very, very cool book well worth their time. Myriad examples from rich and varied domains and a valuable idea on nearly every page. Fun to read, too!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    <title>Programming Excel with VBA and .NET</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why program Excel? For solving complex calculations and presenting results, Excel is amazingly complete with every imaginable feature already in place. But programming Excel isn't about adding new features as much as it's about combining existing features to solve particular problems. With a few modifications, you can transform Excel into a task-specific piece of software that will quickly and precisely serve your needs. In other words, Excel is an ideal platform for probably millions of small spreadsheet-based software solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

The best part is, you can program Excel with no additional tools. A variant of the Visual Basic programming language, VB for Applications (VBA) is built into Excel to facilitate its use as a platform. With VBA, you can create macros and templates, manipulate user interface features such as menus and toolbars, and work with custom user forms or dialog boxes. VBA is relatively easy to use, but if you've never programmed before, &lt;i&gt;Programming Excel with VBA and .NET&lt;/i&gt; is a great way to learn a lot very quickly. If you're an experienced Excel user or a Visual Basic programmer, you'll pick up a lot of valuable new tricks.  Developers looking forward to .NET development will also find discussion of how the Excel object model works with .NET tools, including Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

This book teaches you how to use Excel VBA by explaining concepts clearly and concisely in plain English, and provides plenty of downloadable samples so you can learn by doing. You'll be exposed to a wide range of tasks most commonly performed with Excel, arranged into chapters according to subject, with those subjects corresponding to one or more Excel objects. With both the samples and important reference information for each object included right in the chapters, instead of tucked away in separate sections, &lt;i&gt;Programming Excel with VBA and .NET&lt;/i&gt; covers the entire Excel object library. For those just starting out, it also lays down the basic rules common to all programming languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

With this single-source reference and how-to guide, you'll learn to use the complete range of Excel programming tasks to solve problems, no matter what you're experience level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, it doesn't appear as if much in Excel 2003 has changed. There are a handful of new objects and the user interface is largely the same. But beyond a superficial glance, you'll see that there are fundamental shifts implied by the new features: Lists, XML, web services, .NET, and InfoPath build a framework for entirely new ways to exchange data with Excel.  In fact, that's much of what Excel 2003 is all about--solving problems that deal with teamwork-- collecting and sharing data, programming across applications, and maintaining security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest in our Developer's Notebook series, this guide introduces intermediate to advanced Excel VBA programmers to the newest programming features of Excel 2003,--focusing just on what's new--so you can get up to speed quickly. Light on theory and long on practical application, the book takes you directly to the topics you'll want to master through a series of hands-on projects.  With dozens of practical labs, you'll be able to decide for yourself which new aspects of Excel will be useful or not in your own work. And best of all, you won't have to buy an expensive revision of a legacy Excel programming tutorial to learn about the new features--if they're covered there at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Excel 2003 Programming: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to work with lists and XML data, secure Excel applications, use Visual Studio Tools for Office, consume Web Services, and collect data with Infopath. Each chapter is organized into a collection of labs, each of which addresses a specific programming problem. You can follow along to complete the lab on your own, or jump ahead and use the samples the author has built for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly covers important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing--you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style that suits developers. If you've been curious about Excel 2003, but haven't known where to start, this no-fluff, lab-style guide is the solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wil Wheaton has never been one to take the conventional path to success. Despite early stardom through his childhood role in the motion picture "Stand By Me", and growing up on television as Wesley Crusher on "Star Trek: The Next Generation", Wil left Hollywood in pursuit of happiness, purpose, and a viable means of paying the bills. In the oddest of places, Topeka, Kansas, Wil discovered that despite his claims to fame, he was at heart &lt;i&gt;Just a Geek&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In this bestselling book, Wil shares his deeply personal and difficult journey to find himself.

Through all of this, Wil shares the ups and downs he encountered along the journey, along with the support and love he discovered from his friends and family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The stories in &lt;i&gt;Just a Geek&lt;/i&gt; include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wil's plunge from teen star to struggling actor
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discovering the joys of HTML, blogging, Linux, and web design
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The struggle between Wesley Crusher, Starfleet ensign, and Wil Wheaton, author and blogger
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gut-wrenching reactions to the 9-11 disaster
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Moving tales of Wil's relationships with his wife, step-children, and extended family

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is the comprehensive guide to Samba administration, officially adopted by the Samba Team. Wondering how to integrate Samba's authentication with that of a Windows domain? How to get Samba to serve Microsoft Dfs shares? How to share files on Mac OS X? These and a dozen other issues of interest to system administrators are covered. A whole chapter is dedicated to troubleshooting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The range of this book knows few bounds. Using Samba takes you from basic installation and configuration -- on both the client and server side, for a wide range of systems -- to subtle details of security, cross-platform compatibility, and resource discovery that make the difference between whether users see the folder they expect or a cryptic error message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The current edition covers such advanced 3.x features as:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integration with Active Directory and OpenLDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrating from Windows NT 4.0 domains to Samba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegating administrative tasks to non-root users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Central printer management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced file serving features, such as making use of Virtual File System (VFS) plugins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samba is a cross-platform triumph: robust, flexible and fast, it turns a Unix or Linux system into a file and print server for Microsoft Windows network clients. This book will help you make your file and print sharing as powerful and efficient as possible. The authors delve into the internals of the Windows activities and protocols to an unprecedented degree, explaining the strengths and weaknesses of each feature in Windows domains and in Samba itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're playing on your personal computer or an enterprise network, on one note or a full three-octave range, &lt;em&gt;Using Samba&lt;/em&gt; will give you an efficient and secure server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle designed its database products to be flexible and configurable so they would operate on a variety of hardware platforms, and they succeeded--Oracle software runs on more than seventy computer platforms, from mainframes to PC networks to handheld PDAs. The secret to this flexibility lies in the software's initialization parameters, whose numerous settings can be configured for top performance in countless environments. On the downside, however, improper settings can slow a system down; even grind it to a halt. And with so many parameters--which change from version to version of Oracle software--it's challenging for Oracle administrators to keep in mind the characteristics and optimal settings for each parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Oracle Initialization Parameters Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; provides the crucial information you need to make key adjustments to your Oracle database. This concise guide is a mix of invaluable performance tips and a quick reference to Oracle's initialization parameters. The book describes each initialization parameter, indicates what category it's in--from auditing to multi-threaded server MTS--and whether it can be modified dynamically via the ALTER SESSION or ALTER SYSTEM command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the details about parameter characteristics and settings, you'll find performance tips, such as how the various parameters interact, and what the most advantageous settings are for different configurations. No other reference focuses exclusively on these initialization parameters--an absolute must for anyone working with an Oracle database. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented in a handy, easy-to-use format, the &lt;i&gt;Oracle Initialization Parameters Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is a welcome alternative for anyone who's struggled to memorize the best configuration settings or gone back and forth to online resources, trying to figure out what works. O'Reilly's Pocket References put the information you need close at hand where you need it most.  This guide will keep your Oracle databases operating at peak performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is a fearsomely complex information-processing environment--one that often eludes our ability to understand it.  At any given time, the brain is collecting, filtering, and analyzing information and, in response, performing countless intricate processes, some of which are automatic, some voluntary, some conscious, and some unconscious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive neuroscience is one of the ways we have to understand the workings of our minds. It's the study of the brain biology behind our mental functions:  a collection of methods--like brain scanning and computational modeling--combined with a way of looking at psychological phenomena and discovering where, why, and how the brain makes them happen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know more? &lt;i&gt;Mind Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of probes into the moment-by-moment works of the brain. Using cognitive neuroscience, these experiments, tricks, and tips related to vision, motor skills, attention, cognition, subliminal perception, and more throw light on how the human brain works. Each hack examines specific operations of the brain. By seeing how the brain responds, we pick up clues about the architecture and design of the brain, learning a little bit more about how the brain is put together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mind Hacks&lt;/i&gt; begins your exploration of the mind with a look inside the brain itself, using hacks such as "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Turn On and Off Bits of the Brain" and "Tour the Cortex and the Four Lobes."  Also among the 100 hacks in this book, you'll find:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Release Eye Fixations for Faster Reactions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See Movement When All is Still
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feel the Presence and Loss of Attention
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detect Sounds on the Margins of Certainty
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mold Your Body Schema
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test Your Handedness
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;See a Person in Moving Lights
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make Events Understandable as Cause-and-Effect
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boost Memory by Using Context
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand Detail and the Limits of Attention&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Steven Johnson, author of "Mind Wide Open" writes in his foreword to the book, "These hacks amaze because they reveal the brain's hidden logic; they shed light on the cheats and shortcuts and latent assumptions our brains make about the world." If you want to know more about what's going on in your head, then &lt;i&gt;Mind Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is the key--let yourself play with the interface between you and the world.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Threads are essential to Java programming, but learning to use them effectively is a nontrivial task. This new edition of the classic &lt;i&gt;Java Threads&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to take full advantage of Java's threading facilities and brings you up-to-date with the watershed changes in Java 2 Standard Edition version 5.0 (J2SE 5.0). It provides a thorough, step-by-step approach to threads programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Java's threading system is simple relative to other threading systems. In earlier versions of Java, this simplicity came with tradeoffs: some of the advanced features in other threading systems were not available in Java. J2SE 5.0 changes all that: it provides a large number of new thread-related classes that make the task of writing multithreaded programs that much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll learn where to use threads to increase efficiency, how to use them effectively, and how to avoid common mistakes. This book discusses problems like deadlock, race conditions, and starvation in detail, helping you to write code without hidden bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Threads&lt;/i&gt;, Third Edition, has been thoroughly expanded and revised. It incorporates the concurrency utilities from java.util.concurrent throughout. New chapters cover thread performance, using threads with Swing, threads and Collection classes, thread pools, and threads and I/O (traditional, new, and interrupted). Developers who cannot yet deploy J2SE 5.0 can use thread utilities provided in the Appendix to achieve similar functionality with earlier versions of Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lock starvation and deadlock detection
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Atomic classes and minimal synchronization (J2SE 5.0)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interaction of Java threads with Swing, I/O, and Collection classes
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Programmatically controlled locks and condition variables (J2SE 5.0)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thread performance and security
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thread pools (J2SE 5.0)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thread groups
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Platform-specific thread scheduling
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Task schedulers (J2SE 5.0)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parallelizing loops for multiprocessor machines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
In short, this new edition of &lt;i&gt;Java Threads&lt;/i&gt; covers everything you need to know about threads, from the simplest animation program to the most complex applications. If you plan to do any serious work in Java, you will find this book invaluable.
&lt;p&gt;Scott Oaks is a senior software engineer for the Java Performance Engineering group at Sun Microsystems and the author of four books in the O'Reilly Java series.
Formerly a senior systems engineer at Sun Microsystems, Henry Wong is an independent consultant working on various Java related projects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time is a precious commodity, especially if you're a system administrator. No other job pulls people in so many directions at once.  Users interrupt you constantly with requests, preventing you from getting anything done.  Your managers want you to get long-term projects done but flood you with requests for quick-fixes that prevent you from ever getting to those long-term projects. But the pressure is on you to produce and it only increases with time. What do you do?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The answer is time management. And not just any time management theory--you want &lt;i&gt;Time Management for System Administrators&lt;/i&gt;, to be exact. With keen insights into the challenges you face as a sys admin, bestselling author Thomas Limoncelli has put together a collection of tips and techniques that will help you cultivate the time management skills you need to flourish as a system administrator.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Time Management for System Administrators&lt;/i&gt; understands that an Sys Admin often has competing goals: the concurrent responsibilities of working on large projects and taking care of a user's needs.  That's why it focuses on strategies that help you work through daily tasks, yet still allow you to handle critical situations that inevitably arise.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Among other skills, you'll learn how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage interruptions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eliminate timewasters
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep an effective calendar
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop routines for things that occur regularly
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use your brain only for what you're currently working on
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prioritize based on customer expectations
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Document and automate processes for faster execution&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What's more, the book doesn't confine itself to just the work environment, either.  It also offers tips on how to apply these time management tools to your social life.  It's the first step to a more productive, happier you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This collection of time management tools addresses the very specific needs of embattled system administrators everywhere.  Bestselling author Thomas Limoncelli shows you how to manage interruptions, eliminate timewasters, prioritize based on customer expectations, automate processes for faster execution, and much more.  It's the first step to a more productive, happier you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a network administrator, you're under a lot of pressure to ensure that mission-critical systems are completely safe from malicious code, buffer overflows, stealth port scans, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, CGI attacks, and other network intruders. Designing a reliable way to detect intruders before they get in is an essential--but often overwhelming--challenge. Snort, the defacto open source standard of intrusion detection tools, is capable of performing real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP network. It can perform protocol analysis, content searching, and matching. Snort can save countless headaches; the new &lt;i&gt;Snort Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; will save countless hours of sifting through dubious online advice or wordy tutorials in order to leverage the full power of SNORT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each recipe in the popular and practical problem-solution-discussion O'Reilly cookbook format contains a clear and thorough description of the problem, a concise but complete discussion of a solution, and real-world examples that illustrate that solution. The &lt;i&gt;Snort Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; covers important issues that sys admins and security pros will us everyday, such as:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;installation
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;optimization
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;logging
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;alerting
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;rules and signatures
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;detecting viruses
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;countermeasures
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;detecting common attacks
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;administration
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;honeypots
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;log analysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
But the &lt;i&gt;Snort Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; offers far more than quick cut-and-paste solutions to frustrating security issues.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mono Project is the much talked-about open source initiative to create a Unix implementation of Microsoft's .NET Development Framework.  Its purpose is to allow Unix developers to build and deploy cross-platform .NET applications. The project has also sparked interest in developing components, libraries and frameworks with C#, the programming language of .NET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy?  Some say Mono will become the preferred platform for Linux development, empowering Linux/Unix developers. Others say it will allow Microsoft to embrace, extend, and extinguish Linux. The controversy rages on, but--like many developers--maybe you've had enough talk and want to see what Mono is really all about.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's one way to find out: roll up your sleeves, get to work, and see what you Mono can do.  How do you start? You can research Mono at length. You can play around with it, hoping to figure things out for yourself. Or, you can get straight to work with &lt;i&gt;Mono: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt;--a hands-on guide and your trusty lab partner as you explore Mono 1.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light on theory and long on practical application, &lt;i&gt;Mono: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; bypasses the talk and theory, and jumps right into Mono 1.0.  Diving quickly into a rapid tour of Mono, you'll work through nearly fifty mini-projects that will introduce you to the most important and compelling aspects of the 1.0 release.  Using the task-oriented format of this new series, you'll learn how to acquire, install, and run Mono on Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X.  You'll work with the various Mono components: Gtk#, the Common Language Runtime, the class libraries (both .NET and Mono-provided class libraries), IKVM and the Mono C# compiler. No other resource will take you so deeply into Mono so quickly or show you as effectively what Mono is capable of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly covers important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing--you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style that suits developers. If you've been curious about Mono, but haven't known where to start, this no-fluff, lab-style guide is the solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're an advanced security professional, then you know that the battle to protect online privacy continues to rage on.  Security chat rooms, especially, are resounding with calls for vendors to take more responsibility to release products that are more secure.  In fact, with all the information and code that is passed on a daily basis, it's a fight that may never end.  Fortunately, there are a number of open source security tools that give you a leg up in the battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often a security tool does exactly what you want, right out of the box.  More frequently,  you need to customize the tool to fit the needs of your network structure.  &lt;i&gt;Network Security Tools&lt;/i&gt; shows experienced administrators how to modify, customize, and extend popular open source security tools such as Nikto, Ettercap, and Nessus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concise, high-end guide discusses the common customizations and extensions for these tools, then shows you how to write even more specialized attack and penetration reviews that are suited to your unique network environment.  It also explains how tools like port scanners, packet injectors, network sniffers, and web assessment tools function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the topics covered include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing your own network sniffers and packet injection tools
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing plugins for Nessus, Ettercap, and Nikto
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developing exploits for Metasploit
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Code analysis for web applications
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Writing kernel modules for security applications, and understanding rootkits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
While many books on security are either tediously academic or overly sensational, &lt;i&gt;Network Security Tools&lt;/i&gt; takes an even-handed and accessible approach that will let you quickly review the problem and implement new, practical solutions--without reinventing the wheel.  In an age when security is critical, &lt;i&gt;Network Security Tools&lt;/i&gt; is the resource you want at your side when locking down your network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;System developers have used modeling languages for decades to specify, visualize, construct, and document systems. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is one of those languages.  UML makes it possible for team members to collaborate by providing a common language that applies to a multitude of different systems. Essentially, it enables you to communicate solutions in a consistent, tool-supported language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, UML has become the standard method for modeling software systems, which means you're probably confronting this rich and expressive language more than ever before.  And even though you may not write UML diagrams yourself, you'll still need to interpret diagrams written by others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;UML 2.0 in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; from O'Reilly feels your pain.  It's been crafted for professionals like you who must read, create, and understand system artifacts expressed using UML.  Furthermore, it's been fully revised to cover version 2.0 of the language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive new edition not only provides a quick-reference to all UML 2.0 diagram types, it also explains key concepts in a way that appeals to readers already familiar with UML or object-oriented programming concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The role and value of UML in projects
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The object-oriented paradigm and its relation to the UML
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An integrated approach to UML diagrams
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class and Object, Use Case, Sequence, Collaboration, Statechart, Activity, Component, and Deployment Diagrams
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extension Mechanisms
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Object Constraint Language (OCL)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If you're new to UML, a tutorial with realistic examples has even been included to help you quickly familiarize yourself with the system. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive guide has been fully revised to cover UML 2.0, today's standard method for modeling software systems.  Packed with concise information, it's been crafted to help IT professionals read, create, and understand system artifacts expressed using UML.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book doesn't tell you how to write faster code, or how to write code with fewer memory leaks, or even how to debug code at all. What it does tell you is how to build your product in better ways, how to keep track of the code that you write, and how to track the bugs in your code. Plus some more things you'll wish you had known before starting a project.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Practical Development Environments&lt;/i&gt; is a guide, a collection of advice about real development environments for small to medium-sized projects and groups. Each of the chapters considers a different kind of tool - tools for tracking versions of files, build tools, testing tools, bug-tracking tools, tools for creating documentation, and tools for creating packaged releases. Each chapter discusses what you should look for in that kind of tool and what to avoid, and also describes some good ideas, bad ideas, and annoying experiences for each area. Specific instances of each type of tool are described in enough detail so that you can decide which ones you want to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Developers want to write code, not maintain makefiles. Writers want to write content instead of manage templates. IT provides machines, but doesn't have time to maintain all the different tools. Managers want the product to move smoothly from development to release, and are interested in tools to help this happen more often. Whether as a full-time position or just because they are helpful, all projects have toolsmiths: making choices about tools, installing them, and then maintaining the tools that everyone else depends upon.  This book is especially for everyone who ends up being a toolsmith for his or her group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants a good technical environment for developing their software, and &lt;i&gt;Practical Development Environments&lt;/i&gt; contains helpful guidelines for how to create and maintain a great development environment. It discusses some of the current tools that are available, covering different areas such as version control, build tools, testing tools, bug tracking systems, documentation environments, release tools, and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portable, powerful, and a breeze to use, Python is the popular open source object-oriented programming language used for both standalone programs and scripting applications.  It is now being used by an increasing number of major organizations, including NASA and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated for Python 2.4, The &lt;i&gt;Python Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition offers a wealth of useful code for all Python programmers, not just advanced practitioners.  Like its predecessor, the new edition provides solutions to problems that Python programmers face everyday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It now includes over 200 recipes that range from simple tasks, such as working with dictionaries and list comprehensions, to complex tasks, such as monitoring a network and building a templating system. This revised version also includes new chapters on topics such as time, money, and metaprogramming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of additional topics covered:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manipulating text
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Searching and sorting
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with files and the filesystem
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Object-oriented programming
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dealing with threads and processes
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;System administration
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interacting with databases
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating user interfaces
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Network and web programming
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Processing XML
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Distributed programming
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debugging and testing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Another advantage of The &lt;i&gt;Python Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition is its trio of authors--three well-known Python programming experts, who are highly visible on email lists and in newsgroups, and speak often at Python conferences.
&lt;p&gt;With scores of practical examples and pertinent background information, The &lt;i&gt;Python Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition is the one source you need if you're looking to build efficient, flexible, scalable, and well-integrated systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the three years since Microsoft made C# available, there have been lots of tweaks to the language. That's because C# is not only essential for making .NET work, it's a big way for Microsoft to attract millions of Java, C and C++ developers to the platform. And C# has definitely made some inroads. Because of its popularity among developers, the language received standardization from ECMA International, making it possible to port C# applications to other platforms. To bolster its appeal, C# 2.0 has undergone some key changes as part of Visual Studio 2005 that will make development with .NET quicker and easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's precisely what &lt;i&gt;Visual C# 2005: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; allows you to do. There are some great new features in C# and this unique "all lab, no lecture" guide covers them all with 50 hands-on projects. Each project explores a new feature, with emphasis on changes that increase productivity, simplify programming tasks, and add functionality to applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C#'s component-based design combines the productivity of Microsoft's popular Visual Basic with the raw power of C++ for web-based applications. Many reviewers note a similarity between C# and Java--in fact, a new feature that took the Java development team five years to incorporate into Java is now available in C# 2.0. Called "generics", this feature enables developers to reuse and customize their existing code, so they can dramatically cut down the time it takes to develop new applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Visual C# 2005: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; is full of no-nonsense code without the usual page-filling commentary. You'll find suggestions for further experimentation, links to on-line documentation, plus practical notes and warnings. The book also tells developers how to acquire, install and configure Visual Studio 2005. Are you a coder to the core? Learn what C# 2.0 can do for you now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is the Windows Server version of the classic &lt;i&gt;TCP/IP Network Administration&lt;/i&gt;. Like the book that inspired it, &lt;i&gt;Windows Server 2003 Network Administration&lt;/i&gt; provides an overview of the essential TCP/IP protocols, and explains how to properly manage and configure the services based on these protocols. Any skilled network administrator knows that understanding how things work is as important as knowing how things are done. This book is the essential guide to both, containing everything a network administrator needs to exchange information via the Internet, and to build effective reliable networks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This must-read guide is divided into three distinct sections: fundamental concepts, tutorial, and reference. The first three chapters are a basic discussion of the network protocols and services. This discussion provides the fundamental concepts necessary to understand the rest of the book. The remaining chapters provide a how-to tutorial for planning, installing and configuring various important network services. The book concludes with three appendixes that are technical references for various configuration options.  Content specifics include how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install, configure, and manage a Microsoft DNS and Windows DHCP server
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control remote communications with Microsoft RRAS software
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect hosts with Internet Connection Firewalls
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configure Internet and Intranet Web services with IIS
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design proper security into your network
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Troubleshoot the network when problems develop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you've turned the final page of &lt;i&gt;Windows Server 2003 Network Administration&lt;/i&gt;, you'll not only understand how to network, but also &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This guide is dedicated to helping you master networking on Windows Server 2003 systems.  In addition to fundamental concepts and essential TCP/IP protocols, the book provides a tutorial for planning, installing, and configuring various network programs as they're implemented on Windows servers.  Ideal for system administrators and network managers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Linux Annoyances for Geeks</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;GNU/Linux is an immensely popular operating system that is both extremely stable and reliable. But it can also induce minor headaches at the most inopportune times, if you're not fully up to speed with its capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unique approach to running and administering Linux systems, &lt;i&gt;Linux Annoyances for Geeks&lt;/i&gt; addresses the many poorly documented and under-appreciated topics that make the difference between a system you struggle with and a system you really enjoy. This book is for power users and system administrators who want to clear away barriers to using Linux for themselves and for less-trained users in their organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book meticulously tells you how to get a stubborn wireless card to work under Linux, and reveals little-known sources for wireless driversand information. It tells you how to add extra security to your systems, such as boot passwords, and how to use tools such as rescue disks to overcome overly zealous security measures in a pinch. In every
area of desktop and server use, the book is chock full of advice based on hard-earned experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author Michael Jang has spent many hours trying out software in a wide range of environments and carefully documenting solutions for the most popular Linux distributions. (The book focuses on Red Hat/Fedora, SUSE, and Debian.) Many of the topics presented here are previously undocumented or are discussed only in obscure email archives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the valuable features of this book for system administrators and Linux proponents in general is the organization of step-by-step procedures that they can customize for naive end-users at their sites. Jang has taken into account not only the needs of a sophisticated readership, but the needs of other people those readers may serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a small thing for a user (such as being able to play a CD) or for an administrator (such as updating an organizations' systems from a central server) can make or break the adoption of Linux. This book helps you overcome the most common annoyances in deploying Linux, and trains you in the techniques that will help you overcome other problems you find along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the spirit of the Annoyances series, the book adopts a sympathetic tone that will quickly win you over. Rather than blaming you for possessing limited Linux savvy, &lt;i&gt;Linux Annoyances for Geeks&lt;/i&gt; takes you along for a fun-filled ride as you master the system together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Open Sources 2.0&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of insightful and thought-provoking essays from today's technology leaders that continues painting the evolutionary picture that developed in the 1999 book &lt;i&gt;Open Sources: Voices from the Revolution&lt;/i&gt; .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These essays explore open source's impact on the software industry and reveal how open source concepts are infiltrating other areas of commerce and society. The essays appeal to a broad audience: the software developer will find thoughtful reflections on practices and methodology from leading open source developers like Jeremy Allison and Ben Laurie, while the business executive will find analyses of business strategies from the likes of Sleepycat co-founder and CEO Michael Olson and Open Source Business Conference founder Matt Asay.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
From China, Europe, India, and Brazil we get essays that describe the developing world's efforts to join the technology forefront and use open source to take control of its high tech destiny. For anyone with a strong interest in technology trends, these essays are a must-read.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The enduring significance of open source goes well beyond high technology, however. At the heart of the new paradigm is network-enabled distributed collaboration: the growing impact of this model on all forms of online collaboration is fundamentally challenging our modern notion of community.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What does the future hold? Veteran open source commentators Tim O'Reilly and Doc Searls offer their perspectives, as do leading open source scholars Steven Weber and Sonali Shah. Andrew Hessel traces the migration of open source ideas from computer technology to biotechnology, and Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger and Slashdot co-founder Jeff Bates provide frontline views of functioning, flourishing online collaborative communities.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The power of collaboration, enabled by the internet and open source software, is changing the world in ways we can only begin to imagine.&lt;i&gt;Open Sources 2.0&lt;/i&gt; further develops the evolutionary picture that emerged in the original &lt;i&gt;Open Sources&lt;/i&gt; and expounds on the transformative open source philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a wonderful collection of thoughts and examples by
great minds from the free software movement, and is a must have for
anyone who follows free software development and project histories."&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Open Sources 2.0&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of insightful and thought-provoking essays from today's technology leaders that continues painting the evolutionary picture that developed in the 1999 book &lt;i&gt;Open Sources: Voices from the Revolution&lt;/i&gt; .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These essays explore open source's impact on the software industry and reveal how open source concepts are infiltrating other areas of commerce and society. The essays appeal to a broad audience: the software developer will find thoughtful reflections on practices and methodology from leading open source developers like Jeremy Allison and Ben Laurie, while the business executive will find analyses of business strategies from the likes of Sleepycat co-founder and CEO Michael Olson and Open Source Business Conference founder Matt Asay.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing a good interface isn't easy.  Users demand software that is well-behaved, good-looking, and easy to use.  Your clients or managers demand originality and a short time to market.  Your UI technology -- web applications, desktop software, even mobile devices -- may give you the tools you need, but little guidance on how to use them well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
UI designers over the years have refined the art of interface design, evolving many best practices and reusable ideas.  If you learn these, and understand why the best user interfaces work so well, you too can design engaging and usable interfaces with less guesswork and more confidence.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Designing Interfaces&lt;/i&gt; captures those best practices as design patterns -- solutions to common design problems, tailored to the situation at hand.  Each pattern contains practical advice that you can put to use immediately, plus a variety of examples illustrated in full color.  You'll get recommendations, design alternatives, and warnings
on when not to use them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Each chapter's introduction describes key design concepts that are often misunderstood, such as affordances, visual hierarchy, navigational distance, and the use of color.  These give you a deeper understanding of why the patterns work, and how to apply them with more insight.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A book can't design an interface for you -- no foolproof design process is given here -- but &lt;i&gt;Designing Interfaces&lt;/i&gt; does give you concrete ideas that you can mix and recombine as you see fit.  Experienced designers can use it as a sourcebook of ideas.  Novice designers will find a roadmap to the world of interface and interaction design, with enough guidance to start using these patterns immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This convenient resource offers advice on creating user-friendly interface designs--whether they're delivered on the Web, a CD, or a "smart" devices like a cell phone. Solutions to common UI design problems are expressed as a collection of patterns--each one containing concrete examples, recommendations, and warnings.  Intended for designers with basic UI design knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of a home network is that it can make life so easy--what could be better than sharing an Internet connection so that everyone can be online at the same time? With home networking you can move files from one computer to another, share resources, print to a single printer or multiple printers from any computer in the house, and IM the kids when they're holed up in their rooms.  And the downside?  Anyone who's ever had to troubleshoot a network glitch doesn't need to ask that question. The simple words, "Why can't I print? Why can't I get to the Internet? Why does my computer say 'Access Denied' today, when it worked fine yesterday?" are enough to send the home network administrator running for cover. And the concept of "network security" can keep the soundest sleeper tossing and turning all night.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, more than 8 million homes in the US have installed a network of some kind, and within five years, that number is expected to jump to 37 million. This speaks to the availability of easy-to-install home networking products. Unfortunately, there's also a glut of potential headaches that can occur after installation (and during, sometimes) with no warning label on the box saying, "This product sure to cause annoyances."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But help is here. &lt;i&gt;Home Networking Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; will ease the headaches and annoyances of anyone who runs a home network. This book tackles all the common annoyances associated with running your network--whether it's wired or wireless, or a combination thereof. Its friendly, off-the-cuff approach will put you in a position of power over those home networking glitches, including file sharing, printing, cabling, security, and much more.  You'll find dozens of on-target tips, workarounds, and fixes that will help you improve your home networking experience in every way possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a mainstream business user or a home user with newly installed network hardware, you've probably had your patience tested by frustrating network maintenance issues. Take a stand against annoyances now: just as the bestselling &lt;i&gt;PC Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; brought peace and happiness to PC users everywhere, &lt;i&gt;Home Networking Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; is your ticket to serenity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ASP.NET hit the street a couple of years ago, it was a real eye-opener. Microsoft's tool for creating dynamic, server side web applications introduced Web Forms, a feature with the same rapid drag and drop convenience enjoyed by Visual Basic developers, along with a method for creating XML-based web services. ASP.NET was more than an upgrade of Active Server Pages it was a quantum leap ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Microsoft has a new version of ASP.NET as part of its upcoming next generation  release of the Visual Studio .NET development platform. ASP.NET 2.0 is already available in beta release, and web developers are anxious to get a good look at it. That's exactly what our new Developer's Notebook allows you to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than just an introduction to ASP.NET 2.0, this practical guide acquaints you with all of the new features through nearly 50 hands-on projects. Each one places emphasis on changes in the new release that can increase productivity, simplify programming tasks, and help you add functionality to your applications. For example, ASP.NET 2.0 includes master pages, themes, and skins so you can build applications with a consistent page layout and design. Other changes allow for the automatic creation of web pages for use on mobile devices, while wizards and controls allow you to perform frequent tasks (like data access) without having to write a single line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ASP.NET 2.0: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; also includes suggestions for further experimentation, links to on-line documentation, and practical notes and warnings from the author regarding changes to the new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Developer's Notebooks series from O'Reilly offers an in-depth first look at important new tools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing you'll get the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and code-intensive style. If you want to get up to speed on ASP.NET 2.0 before its official release, this  all lab, no lecture book will get you there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mac OS X has captured the attention of consumers and programmers alike with its ability to run existing Mac programs along with Unix and Open Source software. The latest version, Panther, includes more than a hundred new features and improves many of the technologies underlying Mac OS X, including graphics and the Unix-based core. With more than 500 power tips and tricks for Mac aficionados like yourself, &lt;i&gt;Mac OS X Power Hound&lt;/i&gt;, Panther Edition helps you unleash the power of Panther.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mac OS X Panther is a complex and powerful operating system with a personality all its own. To make your computing experience with Panther as efficient and enjoyable as possible, you need to learn its secrets, appreciate its idiosyncrasies, and be able to customize it to your needs and wants. Author Rob Griffiths shows you how. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creator and editor of the extremely popular Mac OS X Hints Web site (&lt;a href="http://www.macosxhints.com"&gt;www.macosxhints.com&lt;/a&gt;), Griffiths knows Panther inside and out. His &lt;i&gt;Mac OS X Power Hound&lt;/i&gt; lifts the hood on the sleek and elegant, Formula-One-powered operating system and delivers over 500 high-octane secrets in every conceivable category, including the Desktop and Finder, iApps, Mac OS X programs, Mastering the system and Terminal, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office is the number-one selling software for the Mac; the Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Entourage applications are more dominant in the Mac world than they are among PC users. And Microsoft has greatly improved and enhanced Office 2004 to take advantage of the latest Mac OX features. In short, Microsoft Office for the Mac is wildly popular and better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as incredible and powerful it is, the Office 2004 suite comes without a single page of printed instructions. That means you're left to forge your own path through its countless innovative and useful new features and tools--until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Office 2004 for Mac: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is the manual that should have been in the box. It's the map that clearly and easily guides both beginners and veterans through this new suite. Mark H. Walker, Franklin Tessler, and Paul Berkowitz deliver all the practical information you need to master the basics and make the most of all four Office 2004 programs--Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Entourage. It's four books in one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft's own research, the average Office user taps into less than fifteen percent of the suite's features. With first-rate writing, a handcrafted index, and the trademark humor and clarity of every Missing Manual, &lt;i&gt;Office 2004 for Mac: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; will change that. Because this isn't an authorized book, Walker, Tessler, and Berkowitz candidly point out which features are gems in the rough worthy of your focused attention--and which are junkware that you best continue to overlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're an Office beginner eager to master one or all of the applications in the suite or a longtime Office user looking for detailed coverage of what's new (and what's removed) in Office 2004 and hoping to implement power-user techniques for better and more efficient work, this funny and friendly, comprehensive guide will prove indispensable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;QuickTime Java (QJT) is a terrific multimedia toolkit, but it's also terrifying to the uninitiated. Java developers who need to add audio, video, or interactive media creation and playback to their applications find that QTJ is powerful, but not easy to get into. In fact, when it comes to class-count, QuickTime Java is nearly as large as all of Java 1.1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you learn the entire scope of Apple's QuickTime software, you really appreciate the problem. At its simplest, QuickTime allows Mac and Windows users to play audio and video on their computers. But QuickTime is many things: a file format, an environment for media authoring, and a suite of applications that includes browser plug-ins for viewing media within a web page, a PictureViewer for working with still pictures, QuickTime Streaming Server for delivering streaming media files on the Internet in real time, and QuickTime Broadcaster for delivering live events on the Internet. Among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if that weren't daunting enough, the javadocs on QJT are wildly incomplete, and other books on the topic are long out of date and not well regarded, making progress with QTJ extremely difficult. So what can you do? Our new hands-on guide, &lt;i&gt;QuickTime Java: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt;, not only catches up with this technology, but de-mystifies it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This practical "all lab, no lecture" book is an informal, code-intensive workbook that offers the first real look at this important software. Like other titles in our Developer's Notebook series, &lt;i&gt;QuickTime Java: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; is for impatient early adopters who want get up to speed on what they can use right now. It's deliberately light on theory, emphasizing example over explanation and practice over concept, so you can focus on learning by doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;QuickTime Java: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; gives you just the functionality you need from QTJ. Even if you come to realize that 95% of the API is irrelevant to you, this book will help you master the 5% that really counts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Java developers who need to add audio, video, or interactive media creation and playback to their applications find that QuickTime Java is a powerful toolkit, but one that's not easy to get into. This book offers the first real look at this important software with an informal, code-intensive style that lets impatient early adopters focus on learning by doing. You get just the functionality you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to OpenOffice.org, there is an alternative to Microsoft Word. If you've ever been frustrated by Word's quirks and limitations--including its price tag--and longed for a practical alternative, then it's time to break free. OpenOffice.org is the free, open source office suite and its word processor, Writer, has proven extremely popular with both Windows and Linux users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How good can it be if it's free? you might ask.  And how much trouble will it be to install and learn?  A quick tour of the program will show you: the features you use regularly--from formatting and spell check to using templates and creating indexes --are all there.  And Writer's intuitive, surprisingly familiar interface lets you navigate with ease.   To quickly master the ins and outs of Writer, you'll want a copy of &lt;i&gt;OpenOffice.org Writer: The Free Alternative to Microsoft Word&lt;/i&gt;.  This handy reference is packed with essential information to help you learn the basics of Writer and become adept with its advanced features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written for intermediate and advanced users of word processing programs, &lt;i&gt;OpenOffice.org Writer: The Free Alternative to Microsoft Word&lt;/i&gt; provides guidance for common and advanced word processing tasks.  With this book, you'll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set up OOoWriter to work your way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write, edit, and review documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control page layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use templates and styles effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the most from using fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with Tables of contents, indexes, bibliographies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage large or complex documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert, edit and create graphics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a smooth transition from Microsoft Word&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;OpenOffice.org Writer: The Free Alternative to Microsoft Word&lt;/i&gt; provides guidance for anyone who wants to break out of the Word rut. Its detailed Table of Contents make it a handy reference for even the most experienced word processing users who want to get up to speed quickly with this program, or make sure they're taking full advantage of OOo Writer's features.  With the complete office suite included on a CD (which you can install on as many machines as you like), this book makes using Writer an easy decision.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human factors and usability issues have traditionally played a limited role in security research and secure systems development. Security experts have largely ignored usability issues--both because they often failed to recognize the importance of human factors and because they lacked the expertise to address them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But there is a growing recognition that today's security problems can be solved only by addressing issues of usability and human factors. Increasingly, well-publicized security breaches are attributed to human errors that might have been prevented through more usable software. Indeed, the world's future cyber-security depends upon the deployment of security technology that can be broadly used by untrained computer users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Still, many people believe there is an inherent tradeoff between computer security and usability. It's true that a computer without passwords is usable, but not very secure. A computer that makes you authenticate every five minutes with a password and a fresh drop of blood might be very secure, but nobody would use it. Clearly, people need computers, and if they can't use one that's secure, they'll use one that isn't. Unfortunately, unsecured systems aren't usable for long, either. They get hacked, compromised, and otherwise rendered useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is increasing agreement that we need to design secure systems that people can actually use, but less agreement about how to reach this goal.  &lt;i&gt;Security &amp;amp; Usability&lt;/i&gt; is the first book-length work describing the current state of the art in this emerging field. Edited by security experts Dr. Lorrie Faith Cranor and Dr. Simson Garfinkel, and authored by cutting-edge security and human-computer
interaction (HCI) researchers world-wide, this volume is expected to become both a classic reference and an inspiration for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Security &amp;amp; Usability&lt;/i&gt; groups 34 essays into six parts:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Realigning Usability and Security---with careful attention to user-centered design principles, security and usability can be synergistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication Mechanisms-- techniques for identifying and authenticating computer users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure Systems--how system software can deliver or destroy a secure user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privacy and Anonymity Systems--methods for allowing people to control the release of personal information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commercializing Usability: The Vendor Perspective--specific experiences of security and software vendors (e.g.,
IBM, Microsoft, Lotus, Firefox, and Zone Labs) in addressing usability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Classics--groundbreaking papers that sparked the field of security and usability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book is expected to start an avalanche of discussion, new ideas, and further advances in this important field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eclipse platform continues to gain tremendous popularity as both a Java IDE and a Java platform for application programming. One of the core underpinnings of Eclipse is SWT, the Standard Widget Toolkit. This set of components can be used to develop graphical user interfaces in Java,and offer a native-code alternative to Java's Swing and AWT components. Incorporating the look and feel of whatever platform the code is run on, SWT offers a lightning-fast approach to building GUIs, all of which actually &lt;i&gt;look&lt;/i&gt; like they belong on the platform on which they are run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you already know what you want to do--so wading through the basics of user interface design, graphical components, and what a button does is simply a waste of time. Enter &lt;i&gt;SWT: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt;. In typical &lt;i&gt;Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; style, you'll learn how to take SWT out for a spin, make it work for you, and turn it upside down, all without wasted words or space. Each lab in this notebook details a specific task; you can read from the first page to the last, look up just what you need to know, and even squeeze this book into your laptop bag as a quick reference when you forget how to create a multi-tabbed view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Downloading and configuring Eclipse and SWT
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Menus, toolbars, and buttons
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building tabbed layouts and folders
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SWT's unique coolbar control
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding listeners and responding to events
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building a complete SWT-based application&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a "simple" set of operations that allows you to more easily monitor and manage network devices like routers, switches, servers, printers, and more.  The information you can monitor with SNMP is wide-ranging--from standard items, like the amount of traffic flowing into an interface, to far more esoteric items, like the air temperature inside a router.  In spite of its name, though, SNMP is not especially simple to learn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
O'Reilly has answered the call for help with a practical introduction that shows how to install, configure, and manage SNMP.  Written for network and system administrators, the book introduces the basics of SNMP and then offers a technical background on how to use it effectively. &lt;i&gt;Essential SNMP&lt;/i&gt; explores both commercial and open source packages, and elements like OIDs, MIBs, community strings, and traps are covered in depth.  The book contains five new chapters and various updates throughout. Other new topics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expanded coverage of SNMPv1, SNMPv2, and SNMPv3
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expanded coverage of SNMPc
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The concepts behind network management and change management
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RRDTool and Cricket
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The use of scripts for a variety of tasks
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How Java can be used to create SNMP applications
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Net-SNMP's Perl module&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The bulk of the book is devoted to discussing, with real examples, how to use SNMP for system and network administration tasks. Administrators will come away with ideas for writing scripts to help them manage their networks, create managed objects, and extend the operation of SNMP agents.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once demystified, SNMP is much more accessible. If you're looking for a way to more easily manage your network, look no further than &lt;i&gt;Essential SNMP, 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This practical introduction to Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) offers improved coverage of version 3 of the protocol, plus much more information on SNMP scripting and programming. Learn how to install, configure, and use SNMP, so you can more easily manage your network. Includes five new chapters and a host of real examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, groupware bundled with email and calendar applications helped track the flow of work from person to person within an organization. Workflow in today's enterprise means more monitoring and orchestrating massive systems. A new technology called Business Process Management, or BPM, helps software architects and developers design, code, run, administer, and monitor complex network-based business processes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BPM replaces those sketchy flowchart diagrams that business analysts draw on whiteboards with a precise model that uses standard graphical and XML representations, and an architecture that allows it converse with other services, systems, and users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sound complicated? It is. But it's downright frustrating when you have to search the Web for every little piece of information vital to the process. &lt;i&gt;Essential Business Process Modeling&lt;/i&gt; gathers all the concepts, design, architecture, and standard specifications of BPM into one concise book, and offers hands-on examples that illustrate BPM's approach to process notation, execution, administration and monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Mike Havey demonstrates standard ways to code rigorous processes that are centerpieces of a service-oriented architecture (SOA), which defines how networks interact so that one can perform a service for the other. His book also shows how BPM complements enterprise application integration (EAI), a method for moving from older applications to new ones, and Enterprise Service BUS for integrating different web services, messaging, and XML technologies into a single network. BPM, he says, is to this collection of services what a conductor is to musicians in an orchestra: it coordinates their actions in the performance of a larger composition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Essential Business Process Modeling&lt;/i&gt; teaches you how to develop examples of process-oriented applications using free tools that can be run on an average PC or laptop. You'll also learn about BPM design patterns and best practices, as well as some underlying theory. The best way to monitor processes within an enterprise is with BPM, and the best way to navigate BPM is with this valuable book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring workflow today can involve orchestrating massive systems. Business Process Management (BPM) helps developers design, code, run, administer, and monitor enterprise business processes. This guide explains BPM concepts, architecture and specifications, and then teaches you how to develop process-oriented applications using free tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you had a list of the words used to describe sendmail, they'd probably include reliable, flexible, configurable, complex, monolithic, and daunting. But you're not likely to find the word easy. Even seasoned sendmail pros are sometimes frustrated by the intricacies of sendmail's configuration files. With a little determination and the help of a good reference book, like &lt;i&gt;sendmail&lt;/i&gt;, Third Edition, you can master this demanding program. But when there's a significant point release, like sendmail V8.13, where do you turn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent companion to our popular &lt;i&gt;sendmail&lt;/i&gt;, Third Edition, the &lt;i&gt;sendmail 8.13 Companion&lt;/i&gt; provides a timely way to document the improvements in V8.13 in parallel with its release. The book highlights the important changes in the latest update to sendmail, pointing out not just what is handy or nice to have, but what's critical in getting the best behavior from sendmail. This is especially important now that spam is on the rise, and because mobile technology requires roving laptops to use encrypted connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, many of the changes and additions to V8.13 have been driven by the ongoing fight against spam. Anyone concerned about spam--and who isn't?--will benefit greatly by upgrading to V8.13 sendmail. Among its many enhancements, V8.13 includes new routines that support the SPF sending site authentication standard (in the Milter library), simultaneous connection control, high connection rate control, and finer tuning of SASL parameters. The additions to the Milter library, alone, make upgrading worthwhile, but sendmail's connection control makes it a no-brainer. The key to understanding them is the &lt;i&gt;sendmail 8.13 Companion&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into twenty-five chapters that parallel the chapters in the third edition of the &lt;i&gt;sendmail&lt;/i&gt; book. For instance, if you're interested in Options configuration (Chapter 24 in sendmail), you'll turn to Chapter 24 in your companion volume to find out what's new in V8.13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a simple dot release (8.12 to 8.13), V8.13 sendmail has added more features, options, and fundamental changes than any other single dot release has included. If you need to set up or manage sendmail, you'll want this companion volume close at hand. Even if you aren't ready to upgrade to V8.13, you'll find the key to understanding them is the &lt;i&gt;sendmail 8.13 Companion&lt;/i&gt; a useful guide to understanding and staying current with the latest changes in sendmail.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;An excellent companion to our popular &lt;i&gt;sendmail&lt;/i&gt;, Third Edition, this book documents the improvements in V8.13 in parallel with its release. Highlighting the important changes V8.13, the book points out not just what is handy or nice to have, but what's critical in getting the best behavior from sendmail.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With start-up templates for projects ranging from Windows applications to web services, and extensive help and on-line documentation, Visual Studio .NET might be mistaken for a tool for unsophisticated users. It's true that most developers soon discover that the basic operation of Visual Studio is fairly self-explanatory; less obvious are some of the suite's more advanced built-in features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio .Net includes a wealth of little-used capabilities, is very customizable, has a complete automation model, and much more. On top of its regular feature set, there are hosts of free add-ins, macros, and power toys that can further enhance the functionality of Visual Studio. This book is all about exploring these things, and in doing so, becoming a better and more efficient developer.  Developers will learn how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get the most out of projects and solutions, including getting down and dirty with the undocumented format of project and solution files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use these editor features to the fullest, and add additional functionality to the editor through the use of third-party add-ins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn smarter ways to navigate the application and your own source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customize shortcut keys, toolbars, menus, the toolbox, and much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the debugger successfully not only on your source code, but with T-SQL and scripting languages as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically generate code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how the server  can be used to interface with databases, services, and performance counters, as well as WMI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use and create Visual Studio add-ins to extend its functionality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Offering valuable tips, tools, and tricks, &lt;i&gt;Visual Studio Hacks&lt;/i&gt; takes you far beyond the suite's usual capabilities. You can read this book from cover to cover or, because each hack stands its own, you can feel free to browse and jump to the different sections that interest you most. If there's a prerequisite you need to know about, a cross-reference will guide you to the right hack.

    <title>Photoshop CS2 RAW</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RAW file format is the uncompressed data file captured by a digital camera's electronic sensor.  When your camera saves an image in RAW format, settings like white balance, sharpening, contrast and saturation are not applied to the image but are saved instead in a separate header.  Because RAW files remain virtually untouched by in-camera processing, they are essentially the digital equivalent to exposed but undeveloped film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This makes RAW an increasingly popular format with amateur and professional digital photographers, because it affords greater flexibility and control during the editing process-if you know how to work with RAW files.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Most digital camera manufacturers supply their own software for converting RAW data, as do some third party vendors.  Increasingly, however, the RAW converter of choice is a plug-in included in the latest version of Adobe Photoshop, the most popular and widely-used digital image editing tool in the world.  Adobe Photoshop CS2 is emerging as the best place to edit RAW images, and the best way to master this new format is with &lt;i&gt;Photoshop CS2 RAW&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
An important book dedicated to working with RAW in Photoshop, this comprehensive guide features a unique design that helps readers grasp the subject through visual instruction and prompts.  The entire RAW process is explored, from shooting to using the Adobe plug-in converter and new Bridge navigation software.  The primary focus of Photoshop RAW is, as the title suggests, Photoshop editing technique: automating RAW workflow, correcting exposures, extending exposure range, manipulating grayscale and working with the new DNG (Digital Negative) open standard that Adobe supports.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Presented by photographer Mikkel Aaland, a pioneer of digital photography and author of eight books, including O'Reilly's Photoshop for the Web and the award-winning Shooting Digital, &lt;i&gt;Photoshop CS2 RAW&lt;/i&gt; investigates and instructs in an accessible visual style.  Required reading for professionals and dedicated photo hobbyists alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More and more businesses today have their receive phone service through Internet instead of local phone company lines. Many businesses are also using their internal local and wide-area network infrastructure to replace legacy enterprise telephone networks. This migration to a single network carrying voice and data is called convergence, and it's revolutionizing the world of telecommunications by slashing costs and empowering users. The technology of families driving this convergence is called VoIP, or Voice over IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VoIP has advanced Internet-based telephony to a viable solution, piquing the interest of companies small and large. The primary reason for migrating to VoIP is cost, as it equalizes the costs of long distance calls, local calls, and e-mails to fractions of a penny per use. But the real enterprise turn-on is how VoIP empowers
businesses to mold and customize telecom and datacom solutions using a single, cohesive networking platform. These business drivers are so compelling that legacy telephony is going the way of the dinosaur, yielding to Voice over IP as the dominant enterprise communications paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developed from real-world experience by a senior developer, O'Reilly's &lt;i&gt;Switching to VoIP&lt;/i&gt; provides solutions for the most common VoIP migration challenges. So if you're a network professional who is migrating from a traditional telephony system to a modern, feature-rich network, this book is a must-have. You'll
discover the strengths and weaknesses of circuit-switched and packet-switched networks, how VoIP systems impact network infrastructure, as well as solutions for common challenges involved with IP voice migrations. Among the challenges discussed and projects presented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;building a softPBX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;configuring IP phones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring quality of service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;standards-compliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;topological considerations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;coordinating a complete system ?switchover?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;migrating applications like voicemail and directory
services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;retro-interfacing to traditional telephony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supporting mobile users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;security and survivability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dealing with the challenges of NAT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help you grasp the core principles at work, &lt;i&gt;Switching to VoIP&lt;/i&gt; uses a combination of strategy and hands-on "how-to" that introduce VoIP routers and media gateways, various makes of IP telephone equipment, legacy analog phones, IPTables and Linux firewalls, and the Asterisk open source PBX software by Digium.
You'll learn how to build an IP-based or legacy-compatible phone system and voicemail system complete with e-mail integration while becoming familiar with VoIP protocols and devices. &lt;i&gt;Switching to VoIP&lt;/i&gt; remains vendor-neutral and advocates standards, not brands. Some of the standards explored include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;SIP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H.323, SCCP, and IAX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice codecs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.3af&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type of Service, IP precedence, DiffServ, and RSVP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.1a/b/g WLAN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If VoIP has your attention, like so many others, then Switching to VoIP will help you build your own system, install it, and begin making calls. It's the only thing left between you and a modern telecom network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on real-world experience, this handy solutions manual addresses the most common VoIP migration challenges.  Find out how to build your own VoIP system, install it, and begin making calls--so you can start saving today.  Ideal for IT managers, network engineers, and system administrators. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco routers are everywhere that networks are. They come in all sizes, from inexpensive units for homes and small offices to equipment costing well over $100,000 and capable of routing at gigabit speeds. A fixture in today's networks, Cisco claims roughly 70% of the router market, producing high-end switches, hubs, and other network hardware. One unifying thread runs through the product line: virtually all of Cisco's products run the Internetwork Operating System, or IOS.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you work with Cisco routers, it's likely that you deal with Cisco's IOS software--an extremely powerful and complex operating system, with an equally complex configuration language. With a cryptic command-line interface and thousands of commands--some of which mean different things in different situations--it doesn't have a reputation for being user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, there's help. This second edition of &lt;i&gt;Cisco IOS in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; consolidates the most important commands and features of IOS into a single, well-organized volume that you'll find refreshingly user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This handy, two-part reference covers IOS configuration for the TCP/IP protocol family. The first section includes chapters on the user interface, configuring lines and interfaces, access lists, routing protocols, and dial-on-demand routing and security. A brief, example-filled tutorial shows you how to accomplish common tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second part is a classic O'Reilly quick reference to all the commands for working with TCP/IP and the lower-level protocols on which it relies. Brief descriptions and lists of options help you zero in on the commands you for the task at hand. Updated to cover Cisco IOS Software Major Release 12.3, this second edition includes lots of examples of the most common configuration steps for the routers themselves. It's a timely guide that any network administrator will come to rely on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Fully revised, this second edition takes the mystery out of IOS 12.3, the latest unified operating system for Cisco routers.  The book covers IOS configuration for the TCP/IP protocol family, and includes information on the user interface, configuring lines and interfaces, dial-on-demand routing and security, access lists, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Version 5.0 of the Java 2 Standard Edition SDK is the most important upgrade since Java first appeared a decade ago. With Java 5.0, you'll not only find substantial changes in the platform, but to the language itself-something that developers of Java took five years to complete. The main goal of Java 5.0 is to make it easier for you to develop safe, powerful code, but none of these improvements makes Java any easier to learn, even if you've programmed with Java for years. And that means our bestselling hands-on tutorial takes on even greater significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning Java&lt;/i&gt; is the most widely sought introduction to the programming language that's changed the way we think about computing. Our updated third edition takes an objective, no-nonsense approach to the new features in Java 5.0, some of which are drastically different from the way things were done in any previous versions. The most essential change is the addition of "generics", a feature that allows developers to write, test, and deploy code once, and then reuse the code again and again for different data types. The beauty of generics is that more problems will be caught during development, and &lt;i&gt;Learning Java&lt;/i&gt; will show you exactly how it's done.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Java 5.0 also adds more than 1,000 new classes to the Java library. That means 1,000 new things you can do without having to program it in yourself. That's a huge change. With our book's practical examples, you'll come up to speed quickly on this and other new features such as loops and threads. The new edition also includes an introduction to Eclipse, the open source IDE that is growing in popularity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Learning Java&lt;/i&gt;, 3rd Edition addresses all of the important uses of Java, such as web applications, servlets, and XML that are increasingly driving enterprise applications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Prefactoring&lt;/i&gt; approaches software development of new systems using lessons learned from many developers over the years.  It is a compendium of ideas gained from retrospectives on what went right and what went wrong in development.  Some of these ideas came from experience in refactoring.  Refactoring is improving the design of existing code to make it simpler and easier to maintain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
This practical, thought-provoking guide details prefactoring guidelines in design, code, and testing. These guidelines can help you create more readable and maintainable code in your next project.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To help communicate the many facets of this approach, Prefactoring follows the development of a software system for a fictitious client, named Sam, from vision through implementation. Some of the guidelines you'll encounter along the way include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When You're Abstract, Be Abstract All the Way
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Splitters Can Be Lumped Easier Than Lumpers Can Be Split
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do a Little Job Well and You May Be Called Upon Often
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plan Globally, Develop Locally
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communicate with Your Code
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Easiest Code to Debug Is That Which is Not Written
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use the Client's Language
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't Let the Cold Air In
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never Be Silent
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don't Speed Until You Know Where You Are Going &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, an operating system would do its job in the background, while you did yours in the foreground.  In reality, though, operating systems often get in the way, fouling up the process at the most inopportune times.  And Windows XP is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly's popular series for customizing and troubleshooting Windows once again comes to the rescue with &lt;i&gt;Windows XP Annoyances for Geeks&lt;/i&gt;.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of network-based, automated services in the past decade has definitely changed the way businesses operate, but not always for the better. Offering services, conducting transactions and moving data on the Web opens new opportunities, but many CTOs and CIOs are more concerned with the risks. Like the rulers of medieval cities, they've adopted a siege mentality, building walls to keep the bad guys out. It makes for a secure perimeter, but hampers the flow of commerce.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, some corporations are beginning to rethink how they provide security, so that interactions with customers, employees, partners, and suppliers will be richer and more flexible. &lt;i&gt;Digital Identity&lt;/i&gt; explains how to go about it. This book details an important concept known as "identity management architecture" (IMA): a method to provide ample protection while giving good guys access to vital information and systems. In today's service-oriented economy, digital identity is everything. IMA is a coherent, enterprise-wide set of standards, policies, certifications and management activities that enable companies like yours to manage digital identity effectively--not just as a security check, but as a way to extend services and pinpoint the needs of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Author Phil Windley likens IMA to good city planning. Cities define uses and design standards to ensure that buildings and city services are consistent and workable. Within that context, individual buildings--or system architectures--function as part of the overall plan. With Windley's experience as VP of product development for Excite@Home.com and CIO of Governor Michael Leavitt's administration in Utah, he provides a rich, real-world view of the concepts, issues, and technologies behind identity management architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How does digital identity increase business opportunity? Windley's favorite example is the ATM machine. With ATMs, banks can now offer around-the-clock service, serve more customers simultaneously, and do it in a variety of new locations. This fascinating book shows CIOs, other IT professionals, product managers, and programmers how security planning can support business goals and opportunities, rather than holding them at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Network-based, automated services have changed the way businesses operate, but not always for the better. Many companies are more concerned with risk than opportunity. &lt;i&gt;Digital Identity&lt;/i&gt; shows how an enterprise-wide identity management architecture can provide security while ensuring that interactions with customers, employees, partners and suppliers are richer and more flexible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the improved analytical capabilities of Excel, scientists and engineers everywhere are using it--instead of FORTRAN--to solve problems.  And why not?  Excel is installed on millions of computers, features a rich set of built-in analyses tools, and includes an integrated Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language.  No wonder it's today's computing tool of choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Chances are you already use Excel to perform some fairly routine calculations.  Now the &lt;i&gt;Excel Scientific and Engineering Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to leverage Excel to perform more complex calculations, too, calculations that once fell in the domain of specialized tools.  It does so by putting a smorgasbord of data analysis techniques right at your fingertips.  The book shows how to perform these useful tasks and others:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Excel and VBA in general
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Import data from a variety of sources
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analyze data
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform calculations
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visualize the results for interpretation and presentation
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Excel to solve specific science and engineering problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Wherever possible, the &lt;i&gt;Excel Scientific and Engineering Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; draws on real-world examples from a range of scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, and physics. This way, you'll be better prepared to solve the problems you face in your everyday scientific or engineering tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
High on practicality and low on theory, this quick, look-up reference provides instant solutions, or "recipes," to problems both basic and advanced.  And like other books in O'Reilly's popular Cookbook format, each recipe also includes a discussion on how and why it works.  As a result, you can take comfort in knowing that complete, practical answers are a mere page-flip away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This quick, look-up reference is perfect for anyone in the science and engineering community who wants to improve upon their Excel skills.  You'll learn how to leverage Excel to perform both routine and complex calculations, and then visualize the results for presentation.  Features practical data analysis techniques and real-world examples from a range of scientific disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most explosive technological trend over the past two years has been blogging.  As a matter of fact, it's been reported that the number of blogs during that time has grown from 100,000 to 4.8 million-with no end to this growth in sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the technology that makes blogging tick?  The answer is RSS--a format that allows bloggers to offer XML-based feeds of their content.  It's also the same technology that's incorporated into the websites of media outlets so they can offer material (headlines, links, articles, etc.) syndicated by other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the main technology behind this rapidly growing field of content syndication, RSS is constantly evolving to keep pace with worldwide demand.  That's where &lt;i&gt;Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom&lt;/i&gt; steps in.  It provides bloggers, web developers, and programmers with a thorough explanation of syndication in general and the most popular technologies used to develop feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book not only highlights all the new features of RSS 2.0-the most recent RSS specification-but also offers complete coverage of its close second in the XML-feed arena, Atom. The book has been exhaustively revised to explain:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;metadata interpretation
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the different forms of content syndication
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the increasing use of web services
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how to use popular RSS news aggregators on the market&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
After an introduction that examines Internet content syndication in general (its purpose, limitations, and traditions), this step-by-step guide tackles various RSS and Atom vocabularies, as well as techniques for applying syndication to problems beyond news feeds.  Most importantly, it gives you a firm handle on how to create your own feeds, and consume or combine other feeds.
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in producing your own content feed, &lt;i&gt;Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom&lt;/i&gt; is the one book you'll want in hand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This step-by-step guide offers bloggers, web developers, and programmers an understanding of content syndication and the technologies that make it possible. It highlights all the new features of RSS 2.0, and offers complete coverage of its rival technology, Atom.  Confidently teaches you how to produce your own data feeds to syndicate news and blogs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Oracle SQL*Plus Pocket Reference</title>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Oracle SQL&lt;em&gt;Plus Pocket Reference&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a must-have for anyone working with Oracle databases, especially those looking to maximize the effectiveness of SQLPlus.  As Oracle's long-standing interactive query tool, SQL&lt;em&gt;Plus is available at every Oracle site, from the largest data warehouse to the smallest single-user system.  Despite its wide use, however, SQL&lt;/em&gt;Plus is still often not completely understood or fully utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Database administrators and developers alike will therefore find the &lt;i&gt;Oracle SQL&lt;em&gt;Plus Pocket Reference&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt; to be extremely beneficial. In addition to summarizing all of the SQLPlus syntax and format options, including new Oracle Database 10&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; features, this handy, on-the-job guide specifically shows readers how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Differentiate between SQL and SQL&lt;em&gt;Plus
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interact with SQLPlus from both the command line and the web browser
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select, insert, update, and delete data
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Format both text and HTML reports with SQL&lt;em&gt;Plus
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specify SQLPlus commands and format elements
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tune SQL queries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The new third edition of this book has been updated for Oracle Database 10&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; to include information on both SQL*Plus and SQL. New SQL information includes the SELECT statement's new MODEL clause, flashback queries, partition outer joins, and DBMS_XPLAN.
&lt;p&gt;With its quick-reference format and compact size, the &lt;i&gt;Oracle SQL&lt;em&gt;Plus Pocket Reference&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt; follows in the long line of successful "pocket references" offered by O'Reilly.  It also serves as the ideal companion to O'Reilly's larger, more comprehensive book on SQLPlus, the bestselling &lt;i&gt;Oracle SQL*Plus: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Jonathan Gennick is an editor for O'Reilly specializing in database and programming titles, having amassed some 17 years of programming and database management experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This portable, quick-reference guide is a must-have for developers and DBAs looking to maximize use of SQL&lt;em&gt;Plus. The new third edition of the &lt;i&gt;Oracle SQL&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Plus Pocket Reference updates the SQL&lt;em&gt;Plus syntax and format options for Oracle Database 10&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;, Oracle's latest database release. It also describes both command-line and browser-based SQL&lt;/em&gt;Plus, and provides information on new SQL features. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The Art of SQL</title>

      <subject>Programming</subject>
      <subject>General</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the buzz about trendy IT techniques, data processing is still at the core of our systems, especially now that enterprises all over the world are confronted with exploding volumes of data. Database performance has become a major headache, and most IT departments believe that developers should provide simple SQL code to solve immediate problems and let DBAs tune any "bad SQL" later.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;The Art of SQL&lt;/i&gt;, author and SQL expert Stephane Faroult argues that this "safe approach" only leads to disaster. His insightful book, named after Art of War by Sun Tzu, contends that writing quick inefficient code is sweeping the dirt under the rug. SQL code may run for 5 to 10 years, surviving several major releases of the database management system and on several generations of  hardware. The code must be fast and sound from the start, and that requires a firm understanding of SQL and relational theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Art of SQL&lt;/i&gt; offers best practices that teach experienced SQL users to focus on strategy rather than specifics. Faroult's approach takes a page from Sun Tzu's classic treatise by viewing database design as a military campaign. You need knowledge, skills, and talent. Talent can't be taught, but every strategist from Sun Tzu to modern-day generals believed that it can be nurtured through the experience of others. They passed on their experience acquired in the field through basic principles that served as guiding stars amid the sound and fury of battle. This is what Faroult does with SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like a successful battle plan, good architectural choices are based on contingencies. What if the volume of this or that table increases unexpectedly? What if, following a merger, the number of users doubles? What if you want to keep several years of data online? Faroult's way of looking at SQL performance may be unconventional and unique, but he's deadly serious about writing good SQL and using SQL well. &lt;i&gt;The Art of SQL&lt;/i&gt; is not a cookbook, listing problems and giving recipes. The aim is to get you-and your manager-to raise good questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Enterprises throughout the world are confronted with exploding volumes of data, and many IT departments are looking for quick solutions. This insightful book demonstrates that since SQL code may run for 5 to 10 years, and run on different hardware, it must be fast and sound from the start. Expert authors Stephane Faroult and Peter Robson offer SQL best practices and relational theory that force you to focus on strategy rather than specifics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you serious about network security? Then check out SSH, the Secure Shell, which provides key-based authentication and transparent encryption for your network connections.  It's reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems. While it doesn't solve every privacy and security problem, SSH eliminates several of them very effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything you want to know about SSH is in our second edition of &lt;i&gt;SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt;. This updated book thoroughly covers the latest SSH-2 protocol for system administrators and end users interested in using this increasingly popular TCP/IP-based solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does it work? Whenever data is sent to the network, SSH automatically encrypts it. When data reaches its intended recipient, SSH decrypts it. The result is "transparent" encryption-users can work normally, unaware that their communications are already encrypted. SSH supports secure file transfer between computers, secure remote logins, and a unique "tunneling" capability that adds encryption to otherwise insecure network applications. With SSH, users can freely navigate the Internet, and system administrators can secure their networks or perform remote administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written for a wide, technical audience, &lt;i&gt;SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; covers several implementations of SSH for different operating systems and computing environments. Whether you're an individual running Linux machines at home, a corporate network administrator with thousands of users, or a PC/Mac owner who just wants a secure way to telnet or transfer files between machines, our indispensable guide has you covered. It starts with simple installation and use of SSH, and works its way to in-depth case studies on large, sensitive computer networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter where or how you're shipping information, &lt;i&gt;SSH, The Secure Shell: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; will show you how to do it securely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;SSH is a popular protocol for securing your network connections. It's reliable, robust, and reasonably easy to use, and both free and commercial implementations are widely available for most operating systems.

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understanding security&lt;/b&gt;. User accounts, file encryption, and the NTFS file system keep your private files private, while still offering network access to coworkers you specify.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flying the Net&lt;/b&gt;.

Chandu Thota, one of Microsoft's main MapPoint developers and the book's author, has organized the material into four major sections, each dedicated to a different MapPoint technology:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MapPoint 2004 - calculating routes, rendering data maps, integrating with Global Positioning System (GPS) for obtaining real-time location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MapPoint Web Service - techniques for finding points of interest, creating applications using the Find APIs and Route APIs, rendering LineDrive maps and polygons&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MapPoint Location Server - deployment scenarios, getting real-time location using mobile phones, managing contacts and privacy settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MSN Virtual Earth - the basics of programming with new MSN Virtual Earth APIs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The book provides a jumpstart for working with these technologies, including in-depth discussions about the core concepts and sample code provided in C#. It's ideal for anyone who wants to develop locations-based applications with MapPoint technologies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The next time you follow online directions to the airport, you can chalk up an assist to MapPoint's state-of-the-art interactive mapping abilities.  Better yet, you'll know how to create that same type of map yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing like teamwork for making progress on a project, but sharing information and building on each other's successes can be challenging when your team is scattered across the miles. Microsoft's SharePoint helps teams and organizations close the distance. With SharePoint, groups construct web sites specifically for collaboration--sites where individuals can capture and share ideas, and work together on documents, tasks, contacts, and events. It's the next best thing to being in the room together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, much of the documentation for SharePoint is written to help system administrators get it up and running, which often leaves end users in the dark. The &lt;i&gt;SharePoint User's Guide&lt;/i&gt; takes another approach: this quick and easy guide shows you what you need to know to start using SharePoint effectively and how to get the most from it.  You'll learn how to create sites that your organization can use to work together or independently, from an end user's point of view. Now, even beginners can learn how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;access sites that are already set up
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;create new sites
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;personalize sites
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;use the document and picture libraries for adding and editing content
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;add discussion boards and surveys to a site
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;enhance security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
You'll learn how you can receive alerts to tell you when existing documents and information have been changed, or when new information or documents have been added.  You can even share select information with partners or customers outside your organization. No one that uses SharePoint collaboration services can afford to be without this handy book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;SharePoint User's Guide&lt;/i&gt; is designed to help you find answers quickly, explaining key concepts and major points in straightforward language.  With SharePoint, any team or organization can overcome geographic or time-zone challenges, and the &lt;i&gt;SharePoint User's Guide&lt;/i&gt; will show them how. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This straightforward guide shows SharePoint users how to create and use web sites for sharing and collaboration.

    <title>Spring: A Developer's Notebook</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since development first began on Spring in 2003, there's been a constant buzz about it in Java development publications and corporate IT departments.  The reason is clear: Spring is a lightweight Java framework in a world of complex heavyweight architectures that take forever to implement. Spring is like a breath of fresh air to overworked developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Spring, you can make an object secure, remote, or transactional, with a couple of lines of configuration instead of embedded code. The resulting application is simple and clean. In Spring, you can work less and go home early, because you can strip away a whole lot of the redundant code that you tend to see in most J2EE applications. You won't be nearly as burdened with meaningless detail. In Spring, you can change your mind without the consequences bleeding through your entire application. You'll adapt much more quickly than you ever could before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spring: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; offers a quick dive into the new Spring framework, designed to let you get hands-on as quickly as you like. If you don't want to bother with a lot of theory, this book is definitely for you.  You'll work through one example after another. Along the way, you'll discover the energy and promise of the Spring framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This practical guide features ten code-intensive labs that'll rapidly get you up to speed.  You'll learn how to do the following, and more:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;install the Spring Framework
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;set up the development environment
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;use Spring with other open source Java tools such as Tomcat, Struts, and Hibernate
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;master AOP and transactions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;utilize ORM solutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
As with all titles in the Developer's Notebook series, this no-nonsense book skips all the boring prose and cuts right to the chase.  It's an approach that forces you to get your hands dirty by working through one instructional example after another-examples that speak to you instead of at you. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This no-nonsense book quickly gets you up to speed on the new Spring open source framework.  Favoring examples and practical application over theory, &lt;i&gt;Spring: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; features 10 code-intensive labs that'll reveal the many assets of this revolutionary, lightweight architecture.  In the end, you'll understand how to produce simple, clean, and effective applications. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;With hacks that any user can follow, &lt;i&gt;Linux Desktop Hacks&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates how easy it is to modify Linux to suit your desires. The book is packed with tips on customizing and improving the interface, boosting performance, administering your desktop, and generally making the most out of what X, KDE, Gnome, and the console have to offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the practical to the whimsical, and some things you never thought of trying, the hacks in the book include the following, and more:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kill and Resurrect the Master Boot Record
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jazz Up Your Debian System Boot
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Energize Your Console with Macro Music Magic
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Konquer Remote Systems Without Passwords
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run KDE on the Bleeding Edge
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;View Microsoft Word Documents in a Terminal
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read Yahoo! Mail from Any Email Client
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motion Capture and Video Conferencing Fun
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automate Your Life with cron
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect Yourself from Windows Applications
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make an Internet Connection Using Bluetooth and a Mobile Phone
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Print to Unsupported Printers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accelerate Your Gaming&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented computer programming language like Java.  You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
That's how your brain knows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
And that's how your brain will learn Java. &lt;i&gt;Head First Java&lt;/i&gt; combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java.  You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI.  And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform.  Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required.  So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
By exploiting how your brain works, &lt;i&gt;Head First Java&lt;/i&gt; compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information.  Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Head First Java&lt;/i&gt; delivers a highly interactive, multisensory learning experience that lets new programmers pick up the fundamentals of the Java language quickly.  Through mind-stretching exercises, memorable analogies, humorous pictures, and casual language, &lt;i&gt;Head First Java&lt;/i&gt; encourages readers to think like a Java programmer.  This revised second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java development platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, Linux has grown both as an operating system and a tool for personal and business use. Simultaneously becoming more user friendly and more powerful as a back-end system, Linux has achieved new plateaus: the newer filesystems have solidified, new commands and tools have appeared and become standard, and the desktop--including new desktop environments--have proved to be viable, stable, and readily accessible to even those who don't consider themselves computer gurus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Whether you're using Linux for personal software projects, for a small office or home office (often termed the SOHO environment), to provide services to a small group of colleagues, or to administer a site responsible for millions of email and web connections each day, you need quick access to information on a wide range of tools. This book covers all aspects of administering and making effective use of Linux systems. Among its topics are booting, package management, and revision control. But foremost in &lt;i&gt;Linux in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; are the utilities and commands that make Linux one of the most powerful and flexible systems available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now in its fifth edition, &lt;i&gt;Linux in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; brings users up-to-date with the current state of Linux.  Considered by many to be the most complete and authoritative command reference for Linux available, the book covers all substantial user, programming, administration, and networking commands for the most common Linux distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Comprehensive but concise, the fifth edition has been updated to cover new features of major Linux distributions.  Configuration information for the rapidly growing commercial network services and community update services is one of the subjects covered for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But that's just the beginning. The book covers editors, shells, and LILO and GRUB boot options. There's also coverage of Apache, Samba, Postfix, sendmail, CVS, Subversion, Emacs, vi, sed, gawk, and much more. Everything that system administrators, developers, and power users need to know about Linux is referenced here, and they will turn to this book again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This updated fifth edition covers all substantial user, programming, administration, and networking commands for the most common Linux distributions.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What once seemed nearly impossible has turned into reality.  The number of available Internet addresses is now nearly exhausted, due mostly to the explosion of commercial websites and entries from an expanding number of countries. This growing shortage has effectively put the Internet community--and some of its most brilliant engineers--on alert for the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their solution was to create IPv6, a new Internet standard which will ultimately replace the current and antiquated IPv4.  As the new backbone of the Internet, this new protocol would fix the most difficult problems that the Internet faces today--scalability and management.  And even though IPv6's implementation has met with some resistance over the past few years, all signs are now pointing to its gradual worldwide adoption in the very near future.  Sooner or later, all network administrators will need to understand IPv6, and now is a good time to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;IPv6 Network Administration&lt;/i&gt; offers administrators the complete inside info on IPv6.  This book reveals the many benefits as well as the potential downsides of this next-generation protocol.  It also shows readers exactly how to set up and administer an IPv6 network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A must-have for network administrators everywhere, &lt;i&gt;IPv6 Network Administration&lt;/i&gt; delivers an even-handed approach to what will be the most fundamental change to the Internet since its inception.  Some of the other IPv6 assets that are covered include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;routing
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;integrated auto-configuration
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;quality-of-services (QoS)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;enhanced mobility
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;end-to-end security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;IPv6 Network Administration&lt;/i&gt; explains what works, what doesn't, and most of all, what's practical when considering upgrading networks from the current protocol to IPv6. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This essential guide explains what works, what doesn't, and most of all, what's practical about IPv6--the next-generation Internet standard.  A must-have for network administrators everywhere looking to fix their network's scalability and management problems.  Also covers other IPv6 benefits, such as routing, integrated auto-configuration, quality-of-services (QoS), enhanced mobility, and end-to-end security. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

With its hallmark objectivity, the Tiger Edition thoroughly explores the latest features to grace the Mac OS. Which ones work well and which do not? What should you look for? This book tackles Spotlight, an enhanced search feature that helps you find anything on your computer; iChat AV for videoconferencing; Automator for automating repetitive, manual or batch tasks; and  the hundreds of smaller tweaks and changes, good and bad, that Apple's marketing never bothers to mention.&lt;/p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Baseball Hacks&lt;/i&gt; isn't your typical baseball book--it's a book about how to watch, research, and understand baseball. It's an instruction manual for the free baseball databases. It's a cookbook for baseball research. Every part of this book is designed to teach baseball fans how to do something. In short, it's a how-to book--one that will increase your enjoyment and knowledge of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much of the way baseball is played today hinges upon interpreting statistical data. Players are acquired based on their performance in statistical categories that ownership deems most important. Managers make in-game decisions based not on instincts, but on probability - how a particular batter might fare against left-handed
pitching, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this unique book is to show fans all the baseball-related stuff that they can do for free (or close to free). Just as open source projects have made great software freely available, collaborative projects such as Retrosheet and Baseball DataBank have made great data freely available. You can use these data sources to research your favorite players, win your fantasy league, or appreciate the game of baseball even more than you do now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baseball Hacks shows&lt;/i&gt; how easy it is to get data, process it, and use it to truly understand baseball.  The book lists a number of sources for current and historical baseball data, and explains how to load it into a database for analysis.  It then introduces several powerful statistical tools for understanding data and forecasting results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated baseball fan, author Joseph Adler walks readers through the core statistical categories for hitters (batting average, on-base percentage, etc.), pitchers (earned run average, strikeout-to-walk ratio, etc.), and fielders (putouts, errors, etc.). He then extrapolates upon these numbers to examine more advanced data groups like career averages, team stats, season-by-season comparisons, and more. Whether you're a mathematician, scientist, or season-ticket holder to your favorite team, &lt;i&gt;Baseball Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is sure to have something for you.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance praise for Baseball Hacks:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Baseball Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is the best book ever written for understanding and practicing baseball analytics. A must-read for baseball professionals and enthusiasts alike."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Ari Kaplan, database consultant to the Montreal Expos, San Diego Padres, and Baltimore Orioles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The game was born in the 19th century, but the passion for its analysis continues to grow into the 21st.  In &lt;i&gt;Baseball Hacks&lt;/i&gt;, Joe Adler not only demonstrates that
the latest data-mining technologies have useful application to the study of baseball statistics, he also teaches the reader how to do the analysis himself, arming the dedicated baseball fan with tools to take his understanding of the game to a higher level."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Mark E. Johnson, Ph.D., Founder, SportMetrika, Inc. and Baseball Analyst for the 2004 St. Louis Cardinals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a fantasy baseball fanatic, casual fan, or just a statistically inclined mathematician, &lt;i&gt;Baseball Hacks&lt;/i&gt; has something for you.  This comprehensive guide walks readers through the sport's core statistical categories, and then demonstrates how to use this data to truly understand baseball.  Statistical analysis, data mining, probability, forecasting, and other valuable tools are examined.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is rapidly changing the
way businesses track inventory and assets. From Wal-Mart and Tesco to the
U.S. Department of Defense, early efforts are already showing benefits,
but software, integration, and data processing for RFID still present a
challenge. If you are a developer or an architect charged with
developing an RFID system, this book is for you. Drawing on extensive
experience, Bill Glover and Himanshu Bhatt provide you with essential
information on this emerging technology.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With the knowledge you gain in these pages, you will possess the
information and understanding you need to start designing, building, or
integrating with RFID systems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;RFID Essentials&lt;/i&gt; you will find information on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tags and tag protocols, including the Electronic Product Code (EPC)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Readers and reader protocols&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RFID middleware&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Security and privacy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing RFID devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RFID's impact on your architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bill Glover has been writing software since 1981 and has worked as a
programmer, lead developer, or architect on systems of all sizes, from
small, automated systems controlling dams and feedmills up to a
complete redesign and reimplementation of one of the world's busiest
travel web sites. Bill first worked with RFID in 1995, tracking

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is rapidly changing the way businesses track inventory and assets. From Walmart and Tesco, to the U.S. Department of Defense, early efforts are already showing benefit, but software, integration, and data processing for RFID still present a challenge. With the knowledge you gain in &lt;i&gt;RFID Essentials&lt;/i&gt;, you will possess the information and understanding you need to start designing, building, or
integrating with RFID systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This newest programming guide by bestselling author Jesse Liberty isn't your typical Visual Basic book. It's not a primer on the language, and it won't dull your brain with arguments hyping .NET either.  Its goal, rather, is to make you immediately productive, creating Windows and Web applications using Visual Basic 2005 and Visual Studio 2005.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Written for VB6 and novice programmers, the book shows how Visual Basic 2005 can be used to rapidly build modern Windows and web applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What makes this book different is what's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; included. There's no introduction to Visual Basic, no explanation of how it fits into the .NET world. Why waste time reading about something you'll learn for yourself as soon as you start creating applications? You won't even write a "Hello World" program.  With Programming Visual Basic 2005 you'll get started building something meaningful, right away.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The book is divided into three parts--Building Windows Applications, Building Web Applications, and Programming with Visual Basic--each of which could be a book on its own.  The author shares his thorough understanding of the subject matter through lucid explanations and intelligently designed lessons that guide you to increasing levels of expertise. By the time you've finished the book, you'll know how to program both Windows and web applications with VB 2005.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The support for this book extends beyond its covers. Jesse offers a FAQ, Errata, complete source code and a link to a free private support discussion center on his web site: LibertyAssociates.com - just click on books.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jesse Liberty, Microsoft .NET MVP,  is the best-selling author of O'Reilly Media's &lt;i&gt;Programming ASP.NET&lt;/i&gt; and over a dozen other books on web and object-oriented programming. Jesse is a frequent contributor to many industry publications and websites, and has spoken at numerous industry events. He is a former Distinguished Software Engineer at AT&amp;amp;T and Vice President for technology development at CitiBank.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Jesse Liberty's books have successfully guided thousands of programmers into the world of .NET programming, and &lt;i&gt;Programming Visual Basic 2005&lt;/i&gt; is no exception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This information-packed guide helps you understand Visual Basic 2005, the next-generation release of the popular Visual Basic programming language.  This book aims to make you immediately productive in creating Windows and web applications using Visual Basic 2005 and all of its tools.  Perfect for experienced VB6 and novice programmers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today's highly connected world, almost everybody has a web site, from local sewing circles to the world's largest corporations. If you're ready for one of your own, Microsoft's FrontPage 2003 has everything you need to create Web pages. It's true. Your geek friends may howl in contempt if you use FrontPage, but that's because the program has a reputation for spitting out cookie-cutter Web pages with messy, overloaded HTML code that takes forever to load. Not any more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
After listening to complaints, Microsoft has given FrontPage 2003 some pretty advanced features, including an HTML cleanup tool that helps alleviate bloated code, and new support for Macromedia Flash and XML. Now, savvy Web veterans can control as much of the process as they want, and even collaborate on a site with developers who use Dreamweaver, GoLive or other Web authoring tools. Yet, unlike those other tools, FrontPage 2003 still has automated features for beginners who don't know where to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's still one flaw, though. Microsoft's idea of a user manual is a flimsy pamphlet. But that's easily solved. &lt;i&gt;FrontPage 2003: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; offers you everything from the basics to meaty sections on advanced tasks. Our book puts the program's features in context, with clear and thorough chapters that provide valuable shortcuts, workarounds, and just plain common sense, no matter where you weigh in on the technical scale. With it, you can learn to build simple Web pages, or sophisticated ones with tables and Cascading Style Sheets, and find out how to manage and publish a Web site. You'll also learn to create forms, work with databases, and integrate FrontPage with Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you haven't worked with Web pages before, each chapter provides "Up to Speed" sidebars with useful background information. If you do have experience, the "Power Users' Clinic" sidebars offer advanced tips and insights. You won't find tips like those in the pamphlet, or even in the Help file. &lt;i&gt;FrontPage: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; gives you the complete lowdown on the program above and beyond any book on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ready for a web site of your own? Microsoft FrontPage 2003 has everything you need. Your geek friends might howl if you use it, but FrontPage now has advanced features, including support for Flash and XML. Our Missing Manual gives you the best view of the program, along with plenty of shortcuts, workarounds, and plain common sense. You won't find information like that even in the Help file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The book summarizes the steps you need to build everything from standalone SOHO hubs, web servers, and LAN servers to load-balanced clusters and servers consolidated through virtualization. Along the way, you'll learn about all of the tools you need to set up and maintain these working environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linux is now a standard corporate platform with users numbering in the hundreds of millions, and there is a definite shortage of talented administrators. &lt;em&gt;Linux System Administration&lt;/em&gt; is ideal as an introduction to Linux for Unix veterans, MCSEs, and mainframe administrators, and as an advanced (and refresher) guide for existing Linux administrators who will want to jump into the middle of the book. Inside, you'll learn how to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set up a stand-alone Linux server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install, configure, maintain, and troubleshoot a DNS server using BIND&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build an Internet server to manage sites, perform email and file transfers, and more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set up an email service for a small-to-medium-sized site, complete with authentication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install and configure Apache, PHP, and MySQL on a web server built from scratch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combine computers into a load-balanced Apache web server cluster based on the free Linux Virtual Server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set up local network services from distributed file systems to DHCP services, gateway services, print services, user management and more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Linux virtualization with Xen or VMWare to run multiple kernels on one piece of hardware; manage each kernel's access to processor time, devices, and memory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create shell scripts and adapt them for your own needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Back up and restore data with &lt;em&gt;rsync, tar, cdrecord&lt;/em&gt;, Amanda, and MySQL tools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linux System Administration&lt;/em&gt; is not only knowledgeable and practical, but convenient. The ingredients for this book had been scattered throughout mailing lists, forums, and discussion groups, as well as books, periodicals, and the experiences of colleagues. Everything is now in one handy guide. In the course of their research, the authors also solved many problems whose solutions were completely undocumented. They now pass their lessons on to you.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For system administrators, ensuring that all Windows servers are performing optimally is a tall order. The larger the enterprise, the greater the chance for irritating, time-consuming configuration problems. Sometimes, you can determine the root cause of the problem yourself-but that's only if you're lucky.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM), the diagnosis is done for you. MOM monitors server operations and automatically notifies you of problems by sending an immediate alert to your console, email address, or pager. To help you better understand how MOM works, O'Reilly presents &lt;i&gt;Essential Microsoft Operations Manager&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The goal of this comprehensive tutorial is to give first-time MOM administrators a solid foundation for planning, implementing, and administering MOM 2005. Author Chris Fox, a renowned MOM expert, offers the type of practical, real-world advice that you need to improve the performance of your IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After taking you through the entire process of setting up MOM on the network, the book moves on to more advanced administration issues. It carefully instructs you how to program and automate MOM and the agents that reside on the servers themselves. You'll also learn how to manage the scripts that determine which server agents are relevant to report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
By capturing system data, intelligently analyzing it, and then notifying you with a suggested course of action, MOM makes extinguishing fires a breeze. And now, thanks to
&lt;i&gt;Essential Microsoft Operations Manager&lt;/i&gt;, learning how to use MOM is a breeze, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people think of word processing, they think of Microsoft Word. After all, it has been around for more than 20 years-practically an eternity in computer time. But Word has also provided its users-nearly everyone on the face of the planet-with an endless supply of annoyances. That is, until now. &lt;i&gt;Word Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; offers to the point (and often opinionated) solutions to your most vexing editing, formatting, printing, faxing, and scanning problems. It covers everything from installation and templates to tables, columns, and graphics. For example, learn how to stop Word from searching the Web for help, and how to enter the same text easily in multiple parts of a document-and keep it updated automatically. It also provides a gentle introduction to the power of macros so you can slay your annoyances by the truckload. The fixes will work with most versions of Word, including Word 2000, Word 2002 (also known as Word XP), and Word 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the topics covered:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deal with installation issues, crashes, and slowdowns, and dispose of the Office Assistant-either temporarily or forever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master templates, numbering, graphics, hyperlinks, tabs, tables, headers, and other everyday annoyances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tame some of Word's wiliest features, such as Smart Cut and Paste, Click and Type, Mail Merge, AutoCorrect, and AutoText.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Printing, Faxing, and Scanning-need we say more?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to output and distribute your documents with confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to work with other Microsoft applications or Macs? You'll find annoyances dealing with Excel, PowerPoint, and Access, as well as a whole chapter just on Mac Word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Author&lt;/b&gt;
Guy Hart-Davis has been using Microsoft Word for more than 15 years, during which time he has seen its capabilities increase steadily and its annoyances increase exponentially. His other books include &lt;i&gt;Word 2000 Developer's Handbook&lt;/i&gt; (Sybex) and &lt;i&gt;How to Do Everything with Your iPod and iPod mini&lt;/i&gt; (McGraw-Hill). In this book he shares secrets that will quell calm your colleagues, impress your friends, and confound your enemies.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although MySQL's source code is open in the sense of being publicly available, it's essentially closed to you if you don't understand it. In this book, Sasha Pachev -- a former member of the MySQL Development Team -- provides a comprehensive tour of MySQL 5 that shows you how to figure out the inner workings of this powerful database. You'll go right to heart of the database to learn how data structures and convenience functions operate, how to add new storage engines and configuration options, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of &lt;em&gt;Understanding MySQL Internals&lt;/em&gt; begins with an Architecture Overview that provides a brief introduction of how the different components of MySQL work together. You then learn the steps for setting up a working compilable copy of the code that you can change and test at your pleasure. Other sections of the book cover:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core server classes, structures, and API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The communication protocol between the client and the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuration variables, the controls of the server; includes a tutorial on how to add your own&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thread-based request handling -- understanding threads and how they are used in MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of MySQL storage engines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The storage engine interface for integrating third-party storage engines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The table lock manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The parser and optimizer for improving MySQL's performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating a transactional storage engine into MySQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The internals of replication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understanding MySQL Internals&lt;/em&gt; provides unprecedented opportunities for developers, DBAs, database application programmers, IT departments, software vendors, and computer science students to learn about the inner workings of this enterprise-proven database.

It's your guide to discovering and improving a great database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Although MySQL's source code is open in the sense of being publicly available, it's essentially closed to you if you don't understand it. This book provides a comprehensive tour of MySQL 5 that shows you how to figure out the inner-workings of this powerful database. You'll learn how data structures and convenience functions operate, how to add new storage engines and configuration options, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is about writing software that makes the most effective use of the system you're running on -- code that interfaces directly with the kernel and core system libraries, including the shell, text editor, compiler, debugger, core utilities, and system daemons. The majority of both Unix and Linux code is still written at the system level, and &lt;em&gt;Linux System Programming&lt;/em&gt; focuses on everything above the kernel, where applications such as Apache, bash, cp, vim, Emacs, gcc, gdb, glibc, ls, mv, and X exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Written primarily for engineers looking to program (better) at the low level, this book is an ideal teaching tool for any programmer. Even with the trend toward high-level development, either through web software (such as PHP) or managed code (C#), someone still has to write the PHP interpreter and the C# virtual machine. &lt;em&gt;Linux System Programming&lt;/em&gt; gives you an understanding of core internals that makes for better code, no matter where it appears in the stack. Debugging high-level code often requires you to understand the system calls and kernel behavior of your operating system, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Key topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An overview of Linux, the kernel, the C library, and the C compiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading from and writing to files, along with other basic file I/O operations, including how the Linux kernel implements and manages file I/O&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffer size management, including the Standard I/O library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced I/O interfaces, memory mappings, and optimization techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The family of system calls for basic process management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced process management, including real-time processes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File and directories-creating, moving, copying, deleting, and managing them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory management -- interfaces for allocating memory, managing the memory you
have, and optimizing your memory access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signals and their role on a Unix system, plus basic and advanced signal interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time, sleeping, and clock management, starting with the basics and continuing through POSIX clocks and high resolution timers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
With &lt;em&gt;Linux System Programming&lt;/em&gt;, you will be able to take an in-depth look at Linux from both a theoretical and an applied perspective as you cover a wide range of programming topics.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fed up with the high tolls charged by your ordinary telephone service? If you're itching to cut the copper cord with your costly, traditional phone service, you need &lt;i&gt;Talk is Cheap&lt;/i&gt;, the new, easy-to-understand guide to understanding and using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and other Internet telephone options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technologies such as VoIP are gaining a great deal of attention these days as more people switch from standard telephone service to phone service via the Internet. But while the cost savings are outstanding, there are some issues with Internet telephony that you should know about. Are the connections reliable? Is the quality comparable? Will it include 911 services? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Gaskin's &lt;i&gt;Talk is Cheap&lt;/i&gt; addresses these issues and many more by explaining how to make the switch and what the tradeoffs will be if you opt for Internet telephony over traditional phone services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Talk is Cheap&lt;/i&gt; focuses on the increasingly popular services from Vonage, which uses VoIP, and Skype--a free service that operates as a peer-to-peer (P2P) network with the ability to turn any PC, Mac, or Pocket PC into a telephone. The book explains your options; explores the background behind, the workings of, and differences between VoIP and P2P networks; and discusses the advantages and drawbacks of both technologies (including service offerings, quality, capabilities, completion rates, and more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Talk is Cheap&lt;/i&gt; then goes into detail on what you can expect in Internet service from traditional phone companies such as Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T. In addition, you will learn more advanced techniques, including how to turn your Palm or Pocket PC into an Internet phone and how to work with Wi-Fi phones and videophones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A straightforward, quick introduction to the ins and outs of using Internet telephone services, this book provides everything you need to make informed telephone decisions--whether you're thinking about the switch from traditional phone service or have already made it and want to get the most out of your new Internet telephone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More people are switching from standard telephone service to phone service via the Internet.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forget those funky robot toys that were all the rage in the '80s, XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Transformations) is the ultimate transformer.  This powerful language is expert at transforming XML documents into PDF files, HTML documents, JPEG files--virtually anything your heart desires.  As useful as XSLT is, though, most people have a difficult time learning its many peculiarities.  And now Version 2.0, while elegant and powerful, has only added to the confusion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;XSLT Cookbook, Second Edition&lt;/i&gt; wants to set the record straight.  It helps you sharpen your programming skills and overall understanding of XSLT through a collection of detailed recipes.  Each recipe breaks down a specific problem into manageable chunks, giving you an easy-to-grasp roadmap for integrating XSLT with your data and applications.  No other XSLT book around employs this practical problem-solution-discussion format.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In addition to offering code recipes for solving everyday problems with XSLT 1.0, this new edition shows you how to leverage the improvements found in XSLT 2.0, such as how to simplify the string manipulation and date/time conversion processes. The book also covers XPath 2.0, a critical companion standard, as well as topics ranging from basic transformations to complex sorting and linking. It even explores extension functions on a variety of different XSLT processors and shows ways to combine multiple documents using XSLT. Code examples add a real-world dimension to each technique.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Whether you're just starting out in XSLT or looking for advanced techniques, you'll find the level of information you need in &lt;i&gt;XSLT Cookbook, Second Edition&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A collection of detailed code recipes that breaks down everyday XSLT problems into manageable chunks.  Learn how to transform XML documents into PDF files, SVG files, HTML documents, etc.  Other topics include numerical transformation, XPath, date/time conversion, string manipulation, testing and debugging, and complex sorting and linking.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know the rudiments of the SQL query language, yet you feel you aren't taking full advantage of SQL's expressive power. You'd like to learn how to do more work with SQL inside the database before pushing data across the network to your applications. You'd like to take your SQL skills to the next level.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Let's face it, SQL is a deceptively simple language to learn, and many database developers never go far beyond the simple statement: SELECT columns FROM table WHERE conditions.  But there is &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt; much more you can do with the language.  In the &lt;i&gt;SQL Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, experienced SQL developer Anthony Molinaro shares his favorite SQL techniques and features. You'll learn about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Window functions, arguably the most significant enhancement to SQL in the past decade. If you're not using these, you're missing out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Powerful, database-specific features such as SQL Server's PIVOT and UNPIVOT operators, Oracle's MODEL clause, and PostgreSQL's very useful GENERATE_SERIES function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pivoting rows into columns, reverse-pivoting columns into rows, using pivoting to facilitate inter-row calculations, and double-pivoting a result set&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bucketization&lt;/i&gt;, and why you should never use that term in Brooklyn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to create histograms, summarize data into buckets, perform aggregations over a moving range of values, generate running-totals and subtotals, and other advanced, data warehousing techniques&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;The technique of &lt;i&gt;walking a string&lt;/i&gt;, which allows you to use SQL to parse through the characters, words, or delimited elements of a string&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Written in O'Reilly's popular Problem/Solution/Discussion style, the &lt;i&gt;SQL Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is sure to please. Anthony's credo is: "When it comes down to it, we all go to work, we all have bills to pay, and we all want to go home at a reasonable time and enjoy what's still available of our days." The &lt;i&gt;SQL Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; moves quickly from problem to solution, saving you time each step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This convenient guide is for anyone who wants to take his or her SQL skills to the next level.  Packed with over 200 recipes, the &lt;i&gt;SQL Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; helps you conquer common data query and manipulation problems, including those related to window functions, data warehousing, and string manipulation.  Features an easy-to-grasp problem-solution-discussion format.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since its original introduction in 1997, the Unified Modeling Language has revolutionized software development. Every integrated software development environment in the world--open-source, standards-based, and proprietary--now supports UML and, more importantly, the model-driven approach to software development. This makes learning the newest UML standard, UML 2.0, critical for all software developers--and there isn't a better choice than this clear, step-by-step guide to learning the language."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;--Richard Mark Soley, Chairman and CEO, OMG&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're like most software developers, you're building systems that are increasingly complex. Whether you're creating a desktop application or an enterprise system, complexity is the big hairy monster you must manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unified Modeling Language (UML) helps you manage this complexity. Whether you're looking to use UML as a blueprint language, a sketch tool, or as a programming language, this book will give you the need-to-know information on how to apply UML to your project. While there are plenty of books available that describe UML, &lt;i&gt;Learning UML 2.0&lt;/i&gt; will show you how to use it. Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capturing your system's requirements in your model to help you ensure that your designs meet your users' needs&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Modeling the parts of your system and their relationships&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Modeling how the parts of your system work together to meet your system's requirements&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Modeling how your system moves into the real world, capturing how your system will be deployed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging and accessible, this book shows you how to use UML to craft and communicate your project's design. Russ Miles and Kim Hamilton have written a pragmatic introduction to UML based on hard-earned practice, not theory. Regardless of the software process or methodology you use, this book is the one source you need to get up and running with UML 2.0. Additional information including exercises can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.learninguml2.com"&gt;www.learninguml2.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russ Miles is a software engineer for General Dynamics UK, where he works with Java and Distributed Systems, although his passion at the moment is Aspect Orientation and, in particular, AspectJ. Kim Hamilton is a senior software engineer at Northrop Grumman, where she's designed and implemented a variety of systems including web applications and distributed systems, with frequent detours into algorithms development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have programming experience and a familiarity with C--the dominant language in embedded systems--&lt;i&gt;Programming Embedded Systems&lt;/i&gt;, Second Edition is exactly what you need to get started with embedded software. This software is ubiquitous, hidden away inside our watches, DVD players, mobile phones, anti-lock brakes, and even a few toasters. The military uses embedded software to guide missiles, detect enemy aircraft, and pilot UAVs. Communication satellites, deep-space probes, and many medical instruments would have been nearly impossible to create without embedded software.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The first edition of &lt;i&gt;Programming Embedded Systems&lt;/i&gt; taught the subject to tens of thousands of
people around the world and is now considered the bible of embedded programming. This second edition has been updated to cover all the latest hardware designs and development methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The techniques and code examples presented here are directly applicable to real-world embedded software projects of all sorts. Examples use the free GNU software programming tools, the eCos and Linux operating systems, and a low-cost hardware platform specially developed for this book. If you obtain these tools along with
&lt;i&gt;Programming Embedded Systems&lt;/i&gt;, Second Edition, you'll have a full environment for exploring embedded systems in depth. But even if you work with different hardware and software, the principles covered in this book
apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Whether you are new to embedded systems or have done embedded work before, you'll benefit from the topics in this book, which include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How building and loading programs differ from desktop or server
computers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic debugging techniques--a critical skill when working with
minimally endowed embedded systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling different types of memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interrupts, and the monitoring and control of on-chip and external
peripherals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determining whether you have real-time requirements, and whether
your operating system and application can meet those requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task synchronization with real-time operating systems and embedded
Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimizing embedded software for size, speed, and power consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working examples for eCos and embedded Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So whether you're writing your first embedded program, designing the
latest generation of hand-held whatchamacalits, or managing the people
who do, this book is for you. &lt;i&gt;Programming Embedded
Systems&lt;/i&gt; will help you develop the knowledge and skills you
need to achieve proficiency with embedded software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Praise for the first edition:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"This lively and readable book is the perfect introduction for those venturing into embedded systems software development for the first time. It provides in one place all the important topics necessary to orient programmers to the embedded development process.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Lindsey Vereen, Editor-in-Chief, Embedded Systems Programming&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you still designing web sites like it's 1999? If so, you're in for a surprise. Since the last edition of this book appeared five years ago, there has been a major climate change with regard to web standards.  Designers are no longer using (X)HTML as a design tool, but as a means of defining the meaning and structure of content. Cascading Style Sheets are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but rather a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to the layout of the entire page. In fact, following the standards is now a mandate of professional web design.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Our popular reference, &lt;i&gt;Web Design in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, is one of the first books to capture this new web landscape with an edition that's been completely rewritten and expanded to reflect the state of the art. In addition to being an authoritative reference for (X)HTML and Cascading Style Sheets, this book also provides an overview of the unique requirements of designing for the Web and gets to the nitty-gritty of JavaScript and DOM Scripting, web graphics optimization, and multimedia production. It is an indispensable tool for web designers and developers of all levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The third edition covers these contemporary web design topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Structural layer: HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 (9 chapters), including an alphabetical reference of all elements, attributes and character entities&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Presentation layer: Ten all-new chapters on Cascading Style Sheets, Level 2.1, including an alphabetical reference of all properties and values.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Behavior layer: JavaScript and scripting with the Document Object Model (DOM)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Web environment: New web standards, browsers, display devices, accessibility, and internationalization&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Web graphics optimization: Producing lean and mean GIF, JPEG, PNG, and animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Multimedia: Web audio, video, Flash, and PDF&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Organized so that readers can find answers quickly, &lt;i&gt;Web Design in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, Third Edition helps experienced designers come up to speed quickly on standards-based web design, and serves as a quick reference for those already familiar with the new standards and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
There are many books for web designers, but none that address such a wide variety of topics. Find out why nearly half a million buyers have made this the most popular web design book available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to establish and then maintain a successful presence on the Web, designing a creative site is only half the battle.  What good is an intricate Web infrastructure if you're unable to measure its effectiveness?  That's why every business is desperate for feedback on their site's visitors:  Who are they? Why do they visit? What information or service is most valuable to them?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unfortunately, most common Web analytics software applications are long on functionality and short on documentation.  Without clear guidance on how these applications should be integrated into the greater Web strategy, these often expensive investments go underused and underappreciated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Enter &lt;i&gt;Web Site Measurement Hacks&lt;/i&gt;, a guidebook that helps you understand your Web site visitors and how they contribute to your business's success.  It helps organizations and individual operators alike make the most of their Web investment by providing tools, techniques, and strategies for measuring--and then improving--their site's usability, performance, and design.  Among the many topics covered, you'll learn:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;definitions of commonly used terms, such as "key performance indicators" (KPIs)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how to drive potential customers to action
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how to gather crucial marketing and customer data
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;which features are useful and which are superfluous
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;advanced techniques that senior Web site analysts use on a daily basis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
By examining how real-world companies use analytics to their success, &lt;i&gt;Web Site Measurement Hacks&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates how you, too, can accurately measure your Web site's overall effectiveness.  Just as importantly, it bridges the gulf between the technical teams charged with maintaining your Web's infrastructure and the business teams charged with making management decisions.
&lt;p&gt;
It's the technology companion that every site administrator needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it's so large and unregulated, the Internet is a fertile breeding ground for all kinds of scams and schemes.  Usually it's your credit card number they're after, and they won't stop there.  Not just mere annoyances, these scams are real crimes, with real victims.  Now, thanks to  &lt;i&gt;Internet Forensics&lt;/i&gt; from O'Reilly, there's something you can do about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This practical guide to defending against Internet fraud gives you the skills you need to uncover the origins of the spammers, con artists, and identity thieves that plague the Internet.  Targeted primarily at the developer community,  &lt;i&gt;Internet Forensics&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to extract the information that lies hidden in every email message, web page, and web server on the Internet.  It describes the lengths the bad guys will go to cover their tracks, and offers tricks that you can use to see through their disguises.  You'll also gain an understanding for how the Internet functions, and how spammers use these protocols to their devious advantage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The book is organized around the core technologies of the Internet-email, web sites, servers, and browsers.  Chapters describe how these are used and abused and show you how information hidden in each of them can be revealed.  Short examples illustrate all the major techniques that are discussed.  The ethical and legal issues that arise in the uncovering of Internet abuse are also addressed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Not surprisingly, the audience for  &lt;i&gt;Internet Forensics&lt;/i&gt; is boundless.  For developers, it's a serious foray into the world of Internet security; for weekend surfers fed up with spam, it's an entertaining and fun guide that lets them play amateur detective from the safe confines of their home or office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing ordinary about JBoss. What began as an open source EJB container project six years ago has become a fully certified J2EE 1.4 application server with the largest market share, competitive with proprietary Java application servers in features and quality. And with its dynamic architecture, JBoss isn't just a J2EE server. You can alter the services to make J2EE work the way you want, or even throw J2EE away completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than a million downloads, many JBoss users are no longer &lt;i&gt;trying it out&lt;/i&gt; on internal test boxes, but &lt;i&gt;rolling it out&lt;/i&gt; on production machines. &lt;i&gt;JBoss: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; takes you on a complete tour of JBoss in a very unique way: rather than long discussions, you will find code--lots of code. In fact, the book is a collection of hands-on labs that take you through the critical JBoss features step-by-step. You don't just read about JBoss, you learn it through direct practical application. That includes exploring the server's many configurations: from bare features for simple applications, to the lightweight J2EE configuration, to everything JBoss has in store-including Hibernate and Tomcat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JBoss: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; also introduces the management console, the web services messaging features, enhanced monitoring capabilities, and shows you how to improve performance. At the end of each lab, you'll find a section called "What about..." that anticipates and answers likely follow-up questions, along with a section that points you to articles and other resources if you need more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JBoss is truly an extraordinary application server. And we have an extraordinary way for you to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;JBoss is a fully certified J2EE 1.4 application server that's free, popular, and competitive with proprietary Java application servers in features and quality. &lt;i&gt;JBoss: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; takes you on a complete tour of JBoss in a very unique way: rather than long discussions, you will find code--lots of code. In fact, the book is a collection of hands-on labs that take you through the critical JBoss features step-by-step.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;XSLT is an essential tool for converting XML into other kinds of documents: HTML, PDF file, and many others. It's a critical technology for XML-based platforms such as Microsoft .NET, Sun Microsystems' Sun One, as well as for most web browsers and authoring tools.  As useful as XSLT is, however, most people have a difficult time getting used to its peculiar characteristics. The ability to use advanced techniques depends on a clear and exact understanding of how XSLT templates work and interact.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;i&gt;XSLT 1.0 Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; from O'Reilly wants to make sure you achieve that level of understanding.  With its concise approach, this handy pocket guide quickly gets you up to speed on XSLT 1.0 so you can covert XML like a seasoned pro.  In addition to covering the basics of stylesheet structure, it also explains how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;use template rules
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;create a result tree
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;apply conditional processing
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;transform multiple source documents
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;employ number formatting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thanks to their convenient, quick-reference format, O'Reilly's Pocket References spare you from having to hunt through larger books for answers.  They deliver just what you need to get the job done in a timely fashion.  And the &lt;i&gt;XSLT 1.0 Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is no different--it's the ideal companion to have at your desk when you need an answer fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This handy pocket guide quickly gets you up to speed on XSLT so you can convert XML like a seasoned pro.  It covers topics such as stylesheet structure, template rules, result trees, conditional processing, number formatting, and more.  Best of all, its concise approach saves you time, aggravation, and effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Monad (AKA PowerShell)</title>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows PowerShell, formerly know by its codename "Monad" and available now for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows Vista, and soon for Exchange Server 2007 and MOM, is the future of Windows administration. From setting up automated build environments to managing 20,000 Exchange email clients in an organization, any tool that reduces the number of repetitive steps an administrator must perform, is a real win.  Even better, PowerShell part of a major Microsoft initiative that aims to replace a host of Windows management tools with a single, unified shell. This is the promise of PowerShell and the reason IT professionals need to start learning how to use it today&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Reflecting the best of legacy tools such as bash and the Korn shell, PowerShell also breaks new ground in its command language design and its use of the object-oriented .NET Framework. And there is no better way to learn how to put PowerShell to work than to get your hands on &lt;i&gt;Monad&lt;/i&gt;, O'Reilly's innovative, hands-on introduction to the tool.  This concise 200-page book is an exciting tour of some of the new capabilities that
PowerShell puts into the hands of system administrators and power users, and is the perfect complement to existing PowerShell documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; With more than 40 hands-on activities, the book covers every angle, from using PowerShell commands and its object-oriented pipelines to querying systems, generating reports and writing scripts that automate existing tasks.  Adding to the lure is the fact that the book is written by Microsoft manager, Andy Oakley with a Foreword by PowerShell architect Jeffrey Snover-so you can be certain that it's teeming with inside information. &lt;i&gt;Monad&lt;/i&gt; lets you see for yourself how PowerShell can significantly improve your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Because the PowerShell technology has wide appeal, so, too, does this compact guide.  Developers, administrators, and power users alike can all benefit from its insight.  If you're someone who habitually drifts toward the c-m-d keys, knows all of the switches to most command tools, or spends time authoring batch files to solve new challenges, this book is right up your alley. And if your organization plans to upgrade soon to Exchange 2007 or MOM V3, there's no time to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking News: A PowerShell RC1 Update to the book is now available at no charge from the book's catalog page on oreilly.com!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Juniper Networks routing platforms are becoming the go-to solution for core, edge, metro and remote office networks, and JUNOS software is behind it all.  The operating system is so full of industrial-strength routing protocols and IP innovations that those treading into the world of JUNOS will need clarification, explanation, and a showcase example or two.  Look no further. This &lt;i&gt;JUNOS Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; provides it all and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yes, you can mine through the 5,000 pages of documentation or take a two-thousand-dollar training course, but JUNOS's interprocess sophistication can be baffling unless you know the shortcuts and tricks, as well as those rays of illuminating comprehension that can come only from those who live with it.  &lt;i&gt;JUNOS Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is the first comprehensive book about JUNOS software and it provides over 200 time-saving step-by-step techniques including discussions about the processes and alternative ways to perform the same task.  It's been tested and tech-reviewed by field engineers who know how to take JUNOS out for a spin and it's applicable to the entire line of M-, T-, and J-series routers.&lt;i&gt; JUNOS Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; will not only pay for itself the first few times you use it, it will make your network easier to manage and update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Aviva Garrett has done a tremendous job of distilling the features of JUNOS software in a form that will be useful for a wide audience-students, field engineers, network architects, and other networking professionals alike will benefit from this book.  For many people, this is the only book on JUNOS they will need."
Pradeep Sindhu, CTO and Founder, Juniper Networks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"This cookbook is superb.  Aviva Garrett has masterfully assembled a complete set of practical real-world examples with step-by-step instructions. Security, management, routing: it's all here!"
Stephen Gill, Research Fellow, Team Cymru&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dashboards have become popular in recent years as uniquely powerful tools for communicating important information at a glance. Although dashboards are potentially powerful, this potential is rarely realized. The greatest display technology in the world won't solve this if you fail to use effective visual design. And if a dashboard fails to tell you precisely what you need to know in an instant, you'll never use it, even if it's filled with cute gauges, meters, and traffic lights. Don't let your investment in dashboard technology go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This book will teach you the visual design skills you need to create dashboards that communicate clearly, rapidly, and compellingly. &lt;i&gt;Information Dashboard Design&lt;/i&gt; will explain how to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid the thirteen mistakes common to dashboard design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide viewers with the information they need quickly and clearly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply what we now know about visual perception to the visual presentation of information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize distractions, cliches, and unnecessary embellishments that create confusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize business information to support meaning and usability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an aesthetically pleasing viewing experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain consistency of design to provide accurate interpretation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize the power of dashboard technology by pairing it with visual effectiveness&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you find your digital photographs when you need them, or do you spend more time rifling through your hard drive and file cabinets than you'd like?  Do you have a system for assigning and tracking content data on your photos?  If you make a living as a photographer, do your images bear your copyright and contact information, or do they circulate in the marketplace unprotected?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As professional photographer and author Peter Krogh sees it, "your DAM system is fundamental to the way your images are known, both to you and to everyone else."  DAM, or Digital Asset Management, in the world of digital photography refers to every part of the process that follows the taking of the picture, through final output and permanent storage.  Anyone who shoots, scans or stores digital photographs, is practicing some form of digital asset management.  Unfortunately, most of us don't yet know how to manage our files (and our time) very systematically, or efficiently.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;The DAM Book: Digital Asset Management for Photographers&lt;/i&gt;, Krogh brings clarity to the often overwhelming task of managing digital photographs, with a solid plan and practical advice for fellow photographers on how to file, find, protect and re-use photographs.  Following a thorough overview of the DAM system and de-mystifications of metadata and digital archiving, Krogh focuses on best practices for digital photographers using Adobe Photoshop CS2.  He explains how to use Adobe Bridge, the new CS2 navigational software that replaces the File Browser introduced in Photoshop 7, with full details on integrating Bridge, Camera Raw and Digital Asset Management software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Compellingly presented in four-color format, &lt;i&gt;The DAM Book: Digital Asset Management for Photographers&lt;/i&gt; brings Krogh's award-winning creative approach to a subject that could have been technically intimidating.  Instead, Krogh's twenty years of experience and instructive visual storytelling make this material not only accessible, but compulsory reading for serious digital photographers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Photoshop Blending Modes Cookbook for Digital Photographers</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer blending modes have been part of Photoshop for years, but because they're not easy to understand at first glance, this immensely useful feature tends to get overlooked. &lt;i&gt;Photoshop Blending Modes Cookbook for Digital Photographers&lt;/i&gt; is the only recipe-format book that covers blending modes specifically for digital photographers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The book covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Changing hue, saturation, luminosity, and color
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Correcting basic color shifts
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repairing highlights
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sharpening or softening focus
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjusting lighting for subtle or dramatic effects
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Controlling contrast
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating surface effects and textures
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding interest to landscapes and urban scenes
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhancing portraits of children and adults
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simulating graphics arts techiques&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
and much more. &lt;p&gt;
Unlike Photoshop's built-in filters, blending modes don't change the actual pixels that make up an image, so their effects are completely reversible. There are over 20 blending modes in Photoshop CS2, which range from those which darken and lighten images (such as Darken, Multiply, Lighten, and Screen) to modes that increase contrast (such as Overlay and Hard Light) and adjust color (such as Hue, Color. Luminosity, and Saturation).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In addition to covering each blending mode in detail, John Beardsworth, a London-based photographer and author, takes the reader through a whole collection of recipes that demonstrate how to use blending modes alone or in combination to fix problem photos, add subtle effects, and create dramatic images that are truly unique.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With clear, step-by-step instructions, real-world projects, an easy-to-follow format, and hundreds of full-color examples, &lt;i&gt;Photoshop Blending Modes Cookbook for Digital Photographers&lt;/i&gt; is shows you how to use blending modes to achieve a wide range of image adjustments and special effects-without having to first learn everything there is to know about Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adobe Photoshop has become the tool of choice for professional photographers,
designers, and amateur enthusiasts. But it's a complex application with many features-and scant information on how to use them to best advantage. A case in point: there are 100 built-in filters in Photoshop, designed to enable the user to easily make subtle or dramatic image adjustments, and there is very little online help available with the application, and no printed manual. Users can spend hours trying to use filters effectively-an inefficient and often frustrating way to work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Photoshop Filter Effects Encyclopedia&lt;/i&gt;, author and educator Roger Pring explains and decodes the settings of every filter that Photoshop CS2 has to offer, from Artistic filters such as Colored Pencil, Cutout, and Watercolor to Stylize filters like Bevel, Emboss, and Extrude. And, unlike many reference books that give you a lot of information you'll never need, it is filled with easy-to-follow, step-by-step, practical recipes for creating truly amazing effects, such as:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating selective focus
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simulating motion blur
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adding special lens and filter effects
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with tone and color
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating dramatic solarized and posterized images
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with artificial lighting
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simulating textures
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating multi-layered images and photomontages
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reproducing graphic arts effects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
and much more.&lt;p&gt;
The best part is that you don't have to be a Photoshop expert to create sophisticated, professional-looking results-the recipes take the guesswork out of the process, so you can work quickly and efficiently. Packed with hundreds of full-color photographs, clearly written instructions, and practical tips, this book is the ultimate, no-nonsense Photoshop CS2 Filters reference for creative photographers, designers, and artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

With the &lt;i&gt;GDB Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; on hand, the process is quick and painless. The book covers the essentials of using GBD is a testing environment, including how to specify a target for debugging and how to make a program stop on specified conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This handy guide also provides details on using the debugger to examine the stack, source files and data to find the cause of program failure-and then explains ways to use GBD to make quick changes to the program for further testing and debugging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to spot a bug in real time with GDB can save you hours of frustration, and having a quick way to refer to GBD's essential functions is key to making the process work. Once you get your hands on the &lt;i&gt;GDB Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt;, you'll never let go! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an open operating system, Unix can be improved on by anyone and everyone: individuals, companies, universities, and more. As a result, the very nature of Unix has been altered over the years by numerous extensions formulated in an assortment of versions. Today, Unix encompasses everything from Sun's Solaris to Apple's Mac OS X and more varieties of Linux than you can easily name.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The latest edition of this bestselling reference brings Unix into the 21st century.  It's been reworked to keep current with the broader state of Unix in today's world and highlight the strengths of this operating system in all its various flavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Detailing all Unix commands and options, the informative guide provides generous descriptions and examples that put those commands in context.  Here are some of the new features you'll find in &lt;i&gt;Unix in a Nutshell, Fourth Edition&lt;/i&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solaris 10, the latest version of the SVR4-based operating system, GNU/Linux, and Mac OS X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bash shell (along with the 1988 and 1993 versions of ksh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tsch shell (instead of the original Berkeley csh)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package management programs, used for program installation on popular GNU/Linux systems, Solaris and Mac OS X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNU Emacs Version 21&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to source code management systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concurrent versions system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subversion version control system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GDB debugger&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As Unix has progressed, certain commands that were once critical have fallen into disuse.  To that end, the book has also dropped material that is no longer relevant, keeping it taut and current.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you're a Unix user or programmer, you'll recognize the value of this complete, up-to-date Unix reference. With chapter overviews, specific examples, and detailed command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This quick reference has been reworked to present you with the current state of Unix.  Featuring chapter overviews, in-depth command coverage, and specific examples, it's the perfect supplement for Unix users and programmers.  New topics include package management programs, source code management systems, and the Solaris 10, GNU/Linux, and Mac OS X systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest versions of iMovie HD and iDVD 5 are, by far, the most robust moviemaking applications available to consumers today. But whether you're a professional or an amateur moviemaker eager to take advantage of the full capabilities of these applications, don't count on Apple documentation to make the cut. You need &lt;i&gt;iMovie HD &amp;amp; iDVD 5: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;, the objective authority on iMovie HD and iDVD 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you own a previous version of iMovie, the new feature-rich iMovie HD may well be impossible to resist. This video editing program now enables users to capture and edit widescreen High Definition Video (HDV) from the new generation of HDV camcorders, along with standard DV and the MPEG-4 video format. iMovie HD also includes "Magic iMovie" for making finished movies automatically. The feature does everything in one step--imports video into separate clips and adds titles, transitions, and music. The finished video is then ready for iDVD 5, which now includes 15 new themes with animated drop zones that can display video clips across DVD menus, just like the latest Hollywood DVDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This witty and entertaining guide from celebrated author David Pogue not only details every step of iMovie HD video production--from choosing and using a digital camcorder to burning the finished work onto DVDs--but provides a firm grounding in basic film technique so that the quality of a video won't rely entirely on magic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;iMovie HD &amp;amp; iDVD 5: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; includes expert techniques and tricks for:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capturing quality footage (including tips on composition, lighting, and even special-event filming)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building your movie track, incorporating transitions and special effects, and adding narration, music, and sound
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with picture files and QuickTime movies
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reaching your intended audience by exporting to tape, transferring iMovie to QuickTime, burning QuickTime-Movie CDs, and putting movies on the Web (and even on your cell phone!)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using iDVD 5 to stylize and burn your DVD creation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;iMovie HD &amp;amp; iDVD 5: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;--it's your moviemaking-made-easy guide. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Missing Manual is hands-down the bestselling book on iPhoto. And now, updated to cover Apple's newest release, &lt;i&gt;iPhoto 5: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; comes fully loaded--and in full color--so you can exercise all the power, flexibility, and creativity of the stunning new iPhoto 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of iPhoto 5's fifty new features are tiny nips and tucks, such as menu rewordings, quiet refinements, and secret keystrokes that take most people days to stumble through. Others are big-ticket overhauls aimed at both power users (RAW-file import and editing, color correction sliders, real-time histogram) and everyday shutterbugs (nested file folders, individual-photo control in slideshows, and a completely rewritten book-layout kit). Additional improvements include a robust search feature (similar to that of iTunes) and the addition of "objects" for slideshow and book projects (using objects, you can manipulate images without affecting pictures in your master library).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;iPhoto 5: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; covers them all with the scrupulous objectivity, clever wit, and technical wisdom you count on from David Pogue along with the Mac and digital photography expertise of Derrick Story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their authoritative guide starts out with a crash course on digital photography, complete with tutorials on buying a digital camera, composing brilliant photos in various situations (including sports photography, portraits, nighttime photography--even kid photography!) and making digital movies. &lt;i&gt;iPhoto 5: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; then launches into every detail of iPhoto, from camera-meets-Mac basics to storing, searching, and editing; from sharing your digital photography with the world (via customized slideshows--complete with iTunes soundtrack, if you like--prints, photo books, email, the Web, and even your network) to exporting to QuickTime and iDVD. And don't forget iPhoto "stunts," such as building custom screen savers and desktop backdrops; exporting pictures; making the most of plug-ins, add-ons, and beef-ups; using AppleScript; and managing files with backups, CDs, and photo libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;iPhoto 5: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; gives you everything you need to become the digital photographer extraordinaire you want to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a professional musician or a mere novice, Apple's GarageBand software has everything you need to produce commercial-quality recordings entirely on your own.  Just imagine how many thousands of singers and instrumentalists remain undiscovered because they lack the capability to produce viable demos.  Well, no more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now there's no need to assemble a backup band or book time at a professional studio--GarageBand has it covered.  And &lt;i&gt;GarageBand 2: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; gives you the know-how you need to make it all happen.  It's an authoritative, witty guide to constructing digital recordings with GarageBand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Written by the master of the Missing Manual series, and a musician himself, David Pogue, this top-selling book shows you how to maximize the program's entire set of tools.  Pre-recorded loops, sampled sounds, live recordings--they're all explained in easy-to-understand language. It also shows you how to apply professional-sounding effects like reverb or chorusing, and then export the finished product to iTunes, where you can download your work to an iPod, export it as an MP3, or burn it onto CDs.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now revised to reflect GarageBand's latest features, this book's second edition also addresses how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;use GarageBand's eight-track capabilities
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;display music notation in real time
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;enhance timing and pitch for better quality recordings
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;change the tempo and key of recorded instruments
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tune guitars with GarageBand before recording&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So if you're chasing a dream or just having fun, &lt;i&gt;GarageBand 2: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is the only resource you need to make the finest musical recordings possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incomparable iLife '05 is the must-have multimedia suite for everyone who owns a Mac--and the envy of everyone who doesn't. &lt;i&gt;iLife '05: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive iLife '05 book--and what should have come with the suite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no better guide to your iLife experience than the #1 bestselling Macintosh author and expert--and Missing Manual series creator--David Pogue. Totally objective and utterly in-the-know, Pogue highlights the newest features, changes, and improvements of iLife '05, covers the capabilities and limitations of each program within the suite, and delivers countless goodies that you won't find anywhere else: undocumented tips, tricks, and secrets for getting the best performance out of every iLife application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pogue examines all five programs in iLife '05, including:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;iTunes 4.7&lt;/b&gt;. The digital jukebox software for Mac (and Windows) rips songs from music CDs onto your hard drive, organizes and plays your music collection, lets you buy songs from the iTunes Music Store, and syncs all your music with your iPod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;iPhoto 5&lt;/b&gt;. With iPhoto 5, you can pull photos from digital cameras and then organize and present them as a slideshow, desktop picture, screen saver, email attachment, web page, DVD, printout, or hardbound photo book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;iMovie HD&lt;/b&gt;. Now you can easily import and edit video from the newest High Definition camcorders and even little flash media video cams in all the latest formats. You can turn those seemingly endless home movies into short, fun, tightly edited, top-quality highlight reels that friends and family actually beg to watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;iDVD 5&lt;/b&gt;. Transform your iMovie productions and digital slideshows into Hollywood-style DVDs that play on everyday DVD players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;GarageBand 2&lt;/b&gt;. This critically acclaimed program turns a Mac into a digital music-recording studio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
With your authoritative, witty, full color, all-inclusive &lt;i&gt;iLife '05: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; at the ready, there's nothing standing between you and professional-caliber music, photos, movies, and more.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduced by Apple in January 2005, iWork '05 is an innovative new suite of document and presentation software that's the same caliber as Apple's groundbreaking digital media applications and that's wholly dedicated to what Mac users like you care about most: artistry and creativity. iWork '05 isn't about "office productivity"--it's about creating slick and stylish documents and cinema-quality digital presentations that say precisely what you want them to say.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
While iWork '05 helps you create stunning documents and presentations, the suite doesn't come with any in-depth documentation of its own. That's where &lt;i&gt;iWork '05: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; comes in. The book that should have been in the box, it gives you everything you need to master iWork '05. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seamlessly integrated with the wildly popular iLife '05 and designed to take advantage of the advanced typography and graphics engine of Mac OS X, iWork is actually two separate programs: Pages and Keynote 2. Pages is a brand-new, streamlined word processor and page layout program that allows nonprofessionals to quickly and painlessly produce gorgeous brochures, newsletters, letters, invitations, product data sheets, and more. You can start documents from scratch or use one of the 40 professionally designed templates as a starting point. Keynote 2 is a significant upgrade to Keynote, Apple's PowerPoint-like presentation software that allows you to build unique presentations, demonstrations, storyboard animations, interactive slideshows, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like every Missing Manual, this one is refreshingly entertaining and scrupulously detailed. &lt;i&gt;iWork '05: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; gives you all the essentials of Pages and Keynote 2, including an objective look at each program's capabilities, its advantages over similar programs, and its limitations. The book delivers countless goodies that you won't find anywhere else: undocumented tips, tricks, and secrets for getting the very best results from both exciting new applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With the iWork '05 suite and iWork '05: The Missing Manual, you are totally equipped to give your work the style it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Python in a Nutshell</title>

This book offers Python programmers one place to look when they need
help remembering or deciphering the syntax of this open source language
and its many powerful but scantily documented modules. This
comprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the most
frequently needed information--not just about the Python language
itself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard library
and the most important third-party extensions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Ask any Python aficionado and you'll hear that Python programmers have
it all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable and
maintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with components
in C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standard
library and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy to
learn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programming
challenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise and
clear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance in
how best to use Python's great power. &lt;i&gt;Python in a
Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; fills this need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Python in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, Second Edition covers more
than the language itself; it also deals with the most
frequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular and
important third party extensions. Revised and expanded for
Python 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python's new
subprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft's new
IronPython project. Our "Nutshell" format fits Python perfectly by
presenting the highlights of the most important modules and functions
in its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practical
programming needs. This book includes:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,
packages, strings, and regular expressions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A quick reference for Python's built-in types and functions
and key modules &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reference material on important third-party extensions,
such as Numeric and Tkinter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Information about extending and embedding Python &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Python in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; provides a solid,
no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on the
most. This book will immediately earn its place in any Python
programmer's library.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praise for the First Edition:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"In a nutshell, &lt;i&gt;Python in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; serves one
primary goal: to act as an immediately accessible goal for the Python
language. True, you can get most of the same core information that is
presented within the covers of this volume online, but this will
invariably be broken into multiple files, and in all likelihood lacking
the examples or the exact syntax description necessary to truly
understand a command."&lt;br/&gt;
--Richard Cobbett, &lt;i&gt;Linux Format&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"O'Reilly has several good books, of which &lt;i&gt;Python in a
Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; by Alex Martelli is probably the best for giving you
some idea of what Python is about and how to do useful things with it."&lt;br/&gt;
--Jerry Pournelle, &lt;i&gt;Byte Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Python in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; provides a solid, no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on the most. This book will immediately earn its place in any Python programmer's library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tutorial takes photographers beyond the quick tips and gimmicky effects of many digital photography books. Author Katrin Eismann -- an internationally acclaimed artist, bestselling author, and gifted educator -- offers high-profile work, including her own, as examples for teaching photographers how to use the digital medium to create, edit, and output images that reflect their true vision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Co-authored by photographer and teacher Sean Duggan, &lt;em&gt;The Creative Digital Darkroom&lt;/em&gt; translates skills, concepts, and nomenclature of the traditional darkroom into digital solutions for photographers who sense that, despite the newness of the technologies at hand, there remains a timeless method for learning and practicing photography the right way. This is not a Photoshop book per se, but it does focus on the photographic aspects of Photoshop, something other books claim to do but rarely have the discipline to accomplish. &lt;em&gt;The Creative Digital Darkroom&lt;/em&gt; includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four sections that cover the black &amp;amp; white darkroom, the color darkroom, creative techniques, and production essentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapters that begin with a thorough foundation followed by numerous tutorial examples that apply the theory to real-world examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples and a layout that enables readers to find, understand, and apply the featured techniques quickly and easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The authors are both renowned photographers and Photoshop experts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Clearly, &lt;em&gt;The Creative Digital Darkroom&lt;/em&gt; is not your typical digital photography "how to" book. It's ideal for intermediate and advanced photographers, artists, and educators looking for clear, concise, insightful, and inspiring information and techniques on how to make their photographs shine. The language, and techniques will immediately appeal to serious students and professionals, and the original tutorial images and high-profile work will make the book an important visual resource for educators and art appreciators.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we all know by now, wireless networks offer many advantages over fixed (or wired) networks.  Foremost on that list is mobility, since going wireless frees you from the tether of an Ethernet cable at a desk.  But that's just the tip of the cable-free iceberg.  Wireless networks are also more flexible, faster and easier for you to use, and more affordable to deploy and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The de facto standard for wireless networking is the 802.11 protocol, which includes Wi-Fi (the wireless standard known as 802.11b) and its faster cousin, 802.11g.  With easy-to-install 802.11 network hardware available everywhere you turn, the choice seems simple, and many people dive into wireless computing with less thought and planning than they'd give to a wired network. But it's wise to be familiar with both the capabilities and risks associated with the 802.11 protocols.  And &lt;i&gt;802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition is the perfect place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This updated edition covers everything you'll ever need to know about wireless technology.  Designed with the system administrator or serious home user in mind, it's a no-nonsense guide for setting up 802.11 on Windows and Linux.  Among the wide range of topics covered are discussions on:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;deployment considerations
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;network monitoring and performance tuning
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wireless security issues
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;how to use and select access points
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;network monitoring essentials
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;wireless card configuration
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;security issues unique to wireless networks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
With wireless technology, the advantages to its users are indeed plentiful. Companies no longer have to deal with the hassle and expense of wiring buildings, and households with several computers can avoid fights over who's online.  And now, with &lt;i&gt;802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition, you can integrate wireless technology into your current infrastructure with the utmost confidence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to deploy your own wireless network--at home or at the office you must first understand the capabilities and risks associated with the 802.11 protocols.  And &lt;i&gt;802.11 Wireless Networks: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition is the perfect place to start.  This updated edition covers everything you need to know about integrating wireless technology into your current infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available for both the Mac and Windows, Macromedia's Dreamweaver 8 is a professional web design and development program used by millions of Internet professionals to build high-quality static and dynamic database-driven web sites. It offers drag-and-drop simplicity, streamlined HTML coding tools, and powerful database integration features. But Dreamweaver 8 is missing one vital component: a printed manual.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Enter &lt;i&gt;Dreamweaver 8: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;, the completely revised fourth edition of this bestselling book by experienced web site trainer, Macromedia Certified instructor, and Dreamweaver Advisory Council member David McFarland. This book enables both first-time and experienced web designers to create visually stunning and highly interactive web sites.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With crystal-clear writing and much welcome humor, this new edition offers features such as:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Live examples: With McFarland's step-by-step annotated tutorials, you'll learn how to construct a state-of-the-art commercial web site, complete with working forms, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and dynamic databases.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tricks of the trade: The book is bursting with undocumented workarounds and shortcuts for easing the process of building, maintaining, and updating professional web sites.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design guidance: You'll learn to create virtually every modern web feature, including forms, animations, cascading menus, and more--and you'll find out which browsers you need to provide special coding or do extra testing with.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
No matter what your level of expertise is, you'll also learn how to manage your entire web site-whether you've just launched or if it's been around for awhile and takes up thousands of pages. Beginners with no web design experience will appreciate the step-by-step guide to designing, organizing, building, and deploying a web site; long-time Dreamweaver users will appreciate the advanced, real-world techniques for controlling the appearance of their web pages with CSS.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With more than 500 illustrations, a handcrafted index, and the clarity of thought that has made bestsellers of every Missing Manual to date, this is the ultimate atlas for the complex and powerful Dreamweaver 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNS and BIND tells you everything you need to work with one of the Internet's fundamental building blocks: the distributed host information database that's responsible for translating names into addresses, routing mail to its proper destination, and even listing phone numbers with the new ENUM standard.  This book brings you up-to-date with the latest changes in this crucial service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth edition covers BIND 9.3.2, the most recent release of the BIND 9 series, as well as BIND 8.4.7.  BIND 9.3.2 contains further improvements in security and IPv6 support, and important new features such as internationalized domain names, ENUM (electronic numbering), and SPF (the Sender Policy Framework).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you're an administrator involved with DNS on a daily basis or a user who wants to be more informed about the Internet and how it works, you'll find that this book is essential reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What DNS does, how it works, and when you need to use it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to find your own place in the Internet's namespace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up name servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using MX records to route mail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring hosts to use DNS name servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subdividing domains (parenting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securing your name server: restricting who can query your server, preventing unauthorized zone transfers, avoiding bogus servers, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and Transaction Signatures (TSIG)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mapping one name to several servers for load sharing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic updates, asynchronous notification of change to a zone, and incremental zone transfers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Troubleshooting: using nslookup and dig, reading debugging output, common problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DNS programming using the resolver library and Perl's Net::DNS module&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

It covers basic concepts, including Views and editors, as well as features that are not commonly understood, such as Perspectives and Launch Configurations. You'll learn how to write and debug your Java code--and how to integrate that code with tools such as Ant and JUnit. You'll also get a toolbox full of tips and tricks to handle common--and sometimes unexpected--tasks that you'll run across in your Java development cycle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Additionally, the &lt;i&gt;Eclipse IDE Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; has a thorough appendix detailing all of Eclipse's important views, menus, and commands.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;i&gt;Eclipse IDE Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; is just the resource you need for using Eclipse, whether it's on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Podcasting does for Internet audio listeners what TiVo does for television viewers--it puts you in charge of when you enjoy a program. Podcasting is a web-based broadcast medium that sends audio content (most commonly in the MP3 format) directly to an iPod or other digital audio player. You subscribe to audio feeds, receive new files automatically, and listen to them at your convenience.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As you can imagine, podcasting is taking the "blogsphere" by storm. A podcast is a professional-quality Internet radio broadcast, and like blogging and HTML before it, this revolutionary new way of publishing to the Internet has become the new outlet for personal expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you've got Internet access and a copy of Podcasting Hacks, you can find out just how easy it is to listen to and create your own Internet audio programs. With &lt;i&gt;Podcasting Hacks&lt;/i&gt;, Jack Herrington, a software engineer with 20 years of experience developing applications using a diverse set of languages and tools, delivers the ultimate how-to of podcasting for anyone looking to get the most out of this hot new medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since August 2004 (the month that iPodder.com editor Adam Curry considers the start of podcasting), audio blogging has exploded. Podcasts cover every conceivable topic, including sex, relationships, technology, religion, home brewing, recreational drugs, rock 'n roll, food, entertainment, politics, and much more. There were podcasts from the Democratic National Convention in Fall 2004, and some programs on Air America and NPR are also podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Podcasting Hacks&lt;/i&gt; offers expert tips and tools for blogging out loud--for transmitting (and receiving) audio content worldwide with ease. This groundbreaking volume covers both entry-level and advanced topics perfect for aspiring and experienced podcasters. Herrington shows you how to get started, create quality sound, use the right software, develop a great show, distribute a podcast, and build an audience. More advanced topics include audio editing, podcasting on the go, and even videocasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, all you VB6 developers--time's up. As of March 2005, Microsoft no longer supports this version of Visual Basic. And you can't blame them. Three years ago, they introduced the .NET Framework--an elegant, powerful platform--along with the new component-based VB.NET language. But roughly five million of you decided to stick with VB6, mostly to maintain legacy Windows and COM projects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now, with the upcoming release of VB 2005, Microsoft has several attractive reasons to upgrade that you'll find hard to resist, including the return of some VB6 features. And we have the perfect book to help you make the conversion: &lt;i&gt;Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart&lt;/i&gt;. Now, you can test-drive the beta version of VB 2005 with three hands-on projects that enable you to learn the syntax of this new language quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
VB 2005 not only lets you convert the bulk of your existing VB6 code, but offers several familiar features, such as compile-and-run debugging, new MyClasses that simplify use of .NET libraries and frameworks, lots of IDE support for Windows, web and mobile GUI development, and data access controls that closely resemble what you use now. The real plus is that you'll be using these features with the .NET platform, which is more secure, less complex than COM, and offers OneClick deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Visual Basic 2005 Jumpstart&lt;/i&gt; lets you get the feel of this platform for building smart/rich Windows Forms clients, ASP.NET web applications, and web services. Author Wei-Meng Lee, a Microsoft .NET MVP, veteran O'Reilly author and frequent contributor to the O'Reilly Network, has put together three useful test-drive projects, complete with code samples, that let you develop:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A personal library Windows application
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Web-based shopping cart application
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A stock enquiry Web Service&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Our jumpstart guide is the quick, painless way to migrate from VB6 to VB 2005, and the perfect training manual for moving your organization to the more robust, dynamic and secure world of .NET.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the most widely used desktop applications ever created, Excel is familiar to just about everyone with a computer and a keyboard.  Yet most of us don't know the full extent of what Excel can do, mostly because of its recent growth in power, versatility, and complexity.  The truth is that there are many ways Excel can help make your job easier-beyond calculating sums and averages in a standard spreadsheet.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Analyzing Business Data with Excel&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to solve real-world business problems by taking Excel's data analysis features to the max.  Rather than focusing on individual Excel functions and features, the book keys directly on the needs of business users.  Most of the chapters start with a business problem or question, and then show you how to create pointed spreadsheets that address common data analysis issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Aimed primarily at experienced Excel users, the book doesn't spend much time on the basics.  After introducing some necessary general tools, it quickly moves into more specific problem areas, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Statistics
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pivot tables
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workload forecasting
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modeling
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Measuring quality
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitoring complex systems
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Queuing
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimizing
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Importing data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you feel as though you're getting shortchanged by your overall application of Excel, &lt;i&gt;Analyzing Business Data with Excel&lt;/i&gt; is just the antidote.  It addresses the growing Excel data analysis market head on.  Accountants, managers, analysts, engineers, and supervisors-one and all-will learn how to turn Excel functionality into actual solutions for the business problems that confront them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn how to apply Excel's advanced data analysis features to solve real-world business problems.  This hands-on reference targets specific business situations, then demonstrates how to create spreadsheets for these problem areas.  Topics include statistics, pivot tables, workload forecasting, modeling, queuing, data importing, and more.  Perfect for professional Excel users working in an office environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;
What you do need, however, is a comprehensive reference guide so you can benefit from all that Knoppix has to offer.  The &lt;i&gt;Knoppix Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; from O'Reilly fits the bill.

Later, you'll find hacks that cover a variety of advanced projects, from ripping and organizing media files with metatags, to editing video and audio tracks, to creating your own DVDs.  Basic or advanced, each hack stands on its own, so you can feel free to jump around to only the sections that interest you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is divided into five easy-to-understand chapters:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Images: tips range from basic image edits to automated image manipulation&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by a leading developer and maintainer of the Linux kernel,
&lt;i&gt;Linux Kernel in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive
overview of kernel configuration and building, a critical task for
Linux users and administrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No distribution can provide a Linux kernel that meets all users'
needs. Computers big and small have special requirements that require
reconfiguring and rebuilding the kernel. Whether you are trying to
get sound, wireless support, and power management working on a laptop
or incorporating enterprise features such as logical volume management
on a large server, you can benefit from the insights in this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Linux Kernel in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; covers the entire
range of kernel tasks, starting with downloading the source and making
sure that the kernel is in sync with the versions of the tools you
need. In addition to configuration and installation steps, the book
offers reference material and discussions of related topics such as
control of kernel options at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key benefit of the book is a chapter on determining exactly what drivers are needed for your hardware. Also included are recipes that
list what you need to do to accomplish a wide range of popular tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

technology, you'll love &lt;i&gt;MAKE&lt;/i&gt; our new quarterly publication for the
inquisitive do-it-yourselfer. Our third issue looks at how you can turn your car into a Wi-Fi blasting, computer-controlled, GPS-enabled, biodiesel monster. Key features show how to turn a VCR into a pet feeding robot, how to make a see-through potato cannon, create a remote-controlled haunted house for Holloween, and get you the skinny on cheap welding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The third edition profiles Ed Storms, now retired, and formerly employed at
the Los Alamos National Laboratories. For more than a decade, Storms has
been working on low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR.)  If LENRs exist and can
be harnessed, they will provide an alternative power source.  Since they
don't emit chemical pollutants, they may even alleviate global warming.

    <title>MySQL Stored Procedure Programming</title>

      <subject>Database Management</subject>
      <subject>Data Mining</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implementation of stored procedures in MySQL 5.0 a huge
milestone -- one that is expected to lead to widespread enterprise adoption of
the already extremely popular MySQL database. If you are serious about
building the web-based database applications of the future, you need to
get up to speed quickly on how stored procedures work -- and how to
build them the right way. This book, destined to be the bible of stored
procedure development, is a resource that no real MySQL programmer can
afford to do without.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the decade since MySQL burst on the scene, it has become the
dominant open source database, with capabilities and performance
rivaling those of commercial RDBMS offerings like Oracle and SQL
Server. Along with Linux and PHP, MySQL is at the heart of millions of
applications. And now, with support for stored procedures, functions,
and triggers in MySQL 5.0, MySQL offers the programming power needed
for true enterprise use.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
MySQL's new procedural language has a straightforward syntax, making it
easy to write simple programs. But it's not so easy to write secure,
easily maintained, high-performance, and bug-free programs. Few in the
MySQL world have substantial experience yet with stored procedures, but
Guy Harrison and Steven Feuerstein have decades of combined expertise.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;MySQL Stored Procedure Programming&lt;/i&gt;, they put
that hard-won experience to good use. Packed with code examples and covering
everything from language basics to application building to advanced
tuning and best practices, this highly readable book is the one-stop
guide to MySQL development. It consists of four major sections:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MySQL stored programming fundamentals -- tutorial, basic
statements, SQL in stored programs, and error handling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Building MySQL stored programs -- transaction handling,
built-in functions, stored functions, and triggers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MySQL stored programs in applications -- using stored
programs with PHP, Java, Perl, Python, and .NET (C# and VB.NET)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimizing MySQL stored programs -- security, basic and
advanced SQL tuning, optimizing stored program code, and programming
best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A companion web site contains many thousands of lines of code, that you
can put to use immediately.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Guy Harrison is Chief Architect of Database Solutions at Quest Software
and a frequent speaker and writer on MySQL topics. Steven Feuerstein is
the author of &lt;i&gt;Oracle PL/SQL Programming&lt;/i&gt;, the classic reference for Oracle stored programming for more than ten years. Both have decades of experience as database developers, and between them they have authored a dozen books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;MySQL Stored Procedure Programming&lt;/i&gt; covers a lot of ground. The book starts with a thorough introduction to stored procedures programming and functions, covering the fundamentals of data types, operators, and using SQL in stored procedures. You'll learn how to build and maintain stored programs -- covering transactions, stored functions, and triggers -- and how to call and use MySQL-based stored procedures in a variety of languages, including PHP, Perl, Python, .NET, and Java. This book, destined to be the bible of stored procedure development, is a resource that no real MySQL programmer can afford to do without.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there any sexier topic in software development than software testing?  That is, besides game programming, 3D graphics, audio, high-performance clustering, cool websites, et cetera? Okay, so software testing is low on the list.  And that's unfortunate, because good software testing can increase your productivity, improve your designs, raise your quality, ease your maintenance burdens, and help to satisfy your customers, coworkers, and managers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Perl has a strong history of automated tests.  A very early release of Perl 1.0 included a comprehensive test suite, and it's only improved from there.  Learning how Perl's test tools work and how to put them together to solve all sorts of previously intractable problems can make you a better programmer in general.  Besides, it's easy to use the Perl tools described  to handle all sorts of testing problems that you may encounter, even in other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like all titles in O'Reilly's Developer's Notebook series, this "all lab, no lecture" book skips the boring prose and focuses instead on a series of exercises that speak to you instead of at you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; will help you dive right in and:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write basic Perl tests with ease and interpret the results
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply special techniques and modules to improve your tests
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bundle test suites along with projects
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test databases and their data
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Test websites and web projects
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use the "Test Anything Protocol" which tests projects written in languages other than Perl&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With today's increased workloads and short development cycles, unit tests are more vital to building robust, high-quality software than ever before. Once mastered, these lessons will help you ensure low-level code correctness, reduce software development cycle time, and ease maintenance burdens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You don't have to be a die-hard free and open source software developer who lives, breathes, and dreams Perl to use this book.  You just have to want to do your job a little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Good software testing can increase your productivity, improve your designs, raise your quality, and make you more productive overall.  With this series of hands-on labs, you'll learn how Perl's test tools work and how to use them to create basic and complex tests and interpret your results.  &lt;i&gt;Perl Testing: A Developer's Notebook&lt;/i&gt; is ideal if you want to reduce your software development cycle times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But your PC--something that costs a whole lot more and is likely to be used daily and for tasks of far greater importance and complexity--doesn't come with a printed manual. Thankfully, that's not a problem any longer: &lt;i&gt;PCs: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; explains everything you need to know about PCs, both inside and out, and how to keep them running smoothly and working the way you want them to work.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A complete PC manual for both beginners and power users, &lt;i&gt;PCs: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; has something for everyone. PC novices will appreciate the unassuming, straightforward tutorials on PC basics, such as hooking up a monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, and scanner. Families will enjoy sections on networking several computers to share an Internet connection, sharing one monitor between two PCs, connecting portable media players, and creating a home theater system. Adventurous PC users will like the clear photos explaining how to take your PC apart and replace or upgrade any failing parts; IT professionals will be grateful to have something to hand to their coworkers who need solid, trusted information about using their PC.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;PCs: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;, bestselling computer author Andy Rathbone delivers simple, reliable advice on the kinds of things PC users confront every day. He shows you how to connect and configure today's must-have devices (including digital cameras, portable music players, digital camcorders, and keychain drives); burn CDs and DVDs; scan and fax documents, and more. His section on the Internet explains how to choose the best Internet Service Provider and web browser for your needs; send email; find information quickly on the Web; share photos online; set up a blog; set up a webcam; access TV and radio through the Internet; and shop safely online. And Rathbone delivers plenty of guidance on keep your privacy and your PC safe by installing firewalls, creating safe passwords, running antivirus software, removing spyware and adware, and backing up important files.

Bruce believes Java is abandoning its base, and conditions are ripe for an alternative to emerge.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Beyond Java&lt;/i&gt;, Bruce chronicles the rise of the most successful language of all time, and then lays out, in painstaking detail, the compromises the founders had to make to establish success.  Then, he describes the characteristics of likely successors to Java.  He builds to a rapid and heady climax, presenting alternative languages and frameworks with productivity and innovation unmatched in Java. He closes with an evaluation of the most popular and important programming languages, and their future role in a world beyond Java.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you are agree with the book's premise--that Java's reign is coming to an end--then this book will help you start to build your skills accordingly. You can download some of the frameworks discussed and learn a few new languages.  This book will teach you what a new language needs to succeed, so when things do change, you'll be more prepared.  And even if you think Java is here to stay, you can use the best techniques from frameworks introduced in this book to improve what you're doing in Java today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photoshop Elements 4 One-on-One&lt;/i&gt; marks a landmark in computer publishing. In addition to offering 12 lessons of project-based tutorials with all sample files included, each lesson starts with a video introduction, hosted by the author himself, Deke McClelland. And these are no ordinary videos. Produced by Adobe's official video training partner, Total Training, each video measures 960 by 540 pixels and plays at 30 frames per second, with no interlacing. That's a play rate of 15.5 million pixels per second, making this the first computer publication to include high-definition video, playable on any modern PC with a DVD-ROM drive. The picture is so crystal clear, it's like watching the world-reknowned expert work right along with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition to the video -- all new recordings created exclusively for this title -- the book has been completely revamped for Photoshop Elements 4. Inside the full-color pages are new exercises devoted to color-correcting skin tones, auto-tagging images with faces, isolating foreground subjects, extracting people and objects from their backgrounds, creating custom slide shows, correcting red-eye, and sharing images online. Every bit as wildly ambitious and brass-tacks practical as the best-selling image editor itself, &lt;i&gt;Photoshop Elements 4 One-on-One&lt;/i&gt; will have you gasping with amazement at your own creations. Deke puts the magic of digital imaging squarely where it belongs -- in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Revised to cover all the new features of Photoshop Elements 4, this full-color book / high-definition video DVD package gives new users the accessible guidance they need to master this powerful but complex digital imaging program from the ground up, while still providing a wealth of tips, shortcuts, and secrets that even the most experienced Photoshop users won't know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This beautifully illustrated and eminently practical book is the first to offer a complete tour of Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 1.2, the integrated digital photography workflow application that allows serious photographers to import, select, develop and showcase large volumes of digital images. Augmented by photos and case studies from a demanding road test in Iceland, award-winning photographer Mikkel Aaland explains how Lightroom 1.2 can improve the way you work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
After watching -- and often helping -- Adobe create Lightroom entirely from the ground up, Aaland (author of Photoshop CS2 RAW) was ready to see how well it would do in the field. He organized a group of 12 top-notch photographers for a trek to "Nature's Light Room", the pristine Icelandic landscape where each summer day is bathed in 22 hours of horizontal light -- and where the only studio was Lightroom on a laptop. In &lt;em&gt;Photoshop Lightroom Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, Aaland uses hands-on knowledge from the trip to demonstrate how Lightroom 1.2 can help you create the best possible image under any conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This unique tutorial walks you step-by-step through Lightroom's:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Library module&lt;/b&gt; for uploading, sorting, tagging, ranking and adding keywords to your images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Develop module&lt;/b&gt; with Adobe Camera RAW for complete non-destructive color and tonal adjustments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Slideshow module&lt;/b&gt;, where you select and size images, and export the show to HTML, Flash, or PDF formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Print module&lt;/b&gt;, which includes several templates for printing contact sheets or full images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Web module&lt;/b&gt;, where you can create Flash or HTML web galleries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
With many gorgeous examples shot in the soft natural light of Iceland, this book lets you see the results for yourself. Mikkel Aaland's trademark ability to teach complicated topics on digital imaging with straightforward, easy-to-follow text makes this book a valuable learning tool for anyone serious about digital photography. This is not an update of previous Lightroom versions, but the first book that's completely up-to-date for Lightroom 1.2.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

Smart web developers will tell you that the sooner you detect your code mistakes, the quicker you can fix them, and the less the project will cost in the long run.  Well, the most efficient way to detect your mistakes in PHP is with PHPUnit, an open source framework that automates unit testing by running a battery of tests as you go.  The benefits of PHPUnit are significant:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a reduction in the effort required to frequently test code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fewer overall defects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;added confidence in your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improved relations with your open source teammates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The only problem with this popular testing tool was its lack of documentation-until now, that is.  For this, O'Reilly went right to the source, as Sebastian Bergmann, the author of &lt;i&gt;PHPUnit Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt;, also happens to be PHPUnit's creator.  This little book brings together hard-to-remember information, syntax, and rules for working with PHPUnit.  It also delivers the insight and sage advice that can only come from the technology's creator.  Coverage of testing under agile methodologies and Extreme Programming (XP) is also included.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The latest in O'Reilly's series of handy &lt;i&gt;Pocket Guides&lt;/i&gt;, this quick-reference book puts all the answers are right at your fingertips.  It's an invaluable companion for anyone interested in testing the PHP code they write for web applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This handy guide answers all your PHPUnit questions, and then some.  Written by the tool's creator, &lt;i&gt;PHPUnit Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; delivers insight and sage advice not found anywhere else.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Mac OS X garners all the praise from pundits, and Windows XP attracts all the viruses, Linux is quietly being installed on millions of desktops every year. For programmers and system administrators, business users, and educators, desktop Linux is a breath of fresh air and a needed alternative to other operating systems.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;i&gt;Linux Desktop Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; is your introduction to using Linux on five of the most popular distributions: Fedora, Gentoo, Mandriva, SUSE, and Ubuntu. Despite what you may have heard, using Linux is not all that hard. Firefox and Konqueror can handle all your web browsing needs; GAIM and Kopete allow you to chat with your friends on the AOL, MSN, and Yahoo! networks; and the email programs Evolution and Kontact provide the same functionality as Microsoft Outlook, with none of the cost. All of these programs run within the beautiful, feature-packed, and easy-to-use GNOME or KDE desktop environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
No operating system truly "just works," and Linux is no exception. Although Linux is capable of running on most any computing hardware that Microsoft Windows can use, you sometimes need to tweak it just a little to make it work the way you really want. To help you with this task, &lt;i&gt;Linux Desktop Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; covers essential topics, such as configuring your video card, screen resolution, sound, and wireless networking. And laptop users are not left out--an entire section is devoted to the laptop issues of battery life, sleep, and hibernate modes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to advertising on the web, you just can't argue with the numbers. A $7 billion market today is expected to grow to $18.9 billion by 2010. Jupiter Research also estimates that search advertising will be a larger share of the market than display advertising by 2010. These phenomenal numbers are due largely to Google, which has changed the way the world publishes content - and advertises.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Google Advertising Tools&lt;/i&gt; from O'Reilly examines the business and technology behind making money with content and advertising on the web. This focused, easy-to-read guide shows you how to use Google's advertising services to make it happen. You'll find all the background information you need to work with Google AdSense, which automatically delivers text and image ads that are precisely targeted to your site, and Google AdWords, which lets you generate text ads that accompany specific search term results.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book has specific and detailed sections on:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turning your web site into a profit center with AdSense&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making sense of AdSense metrics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Driving traffic to your site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimizing sites for search engine placement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working with AdWords campaigns, auctions, and reports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing campaigns dynamically using the AdWords APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Once you've read all four parts, you'll have a comprehensive picture of how advertising works on the web and how you can use the Google advertising programs to your advantage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive guide takes a close look at advertising on the web-how it works and how Google's advertising programs can turn your site into a money maker.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) (formerly known by its code name "Avalon") is a brand-new presentation framework for Windows XP and Windows Vista, the next version of the Windows client operating system. For developers, WPF is a cornucopia of new technologies, including a new graphics engine that supports 3-D graphics, animation, and more; an XML-based markup language (XAML) for declaring the structure of your Windows UI; and a radical new model for controls.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Programming Windows Presentation Foundation&lt;/i&gt;, authored by Microsoft Software Legend Chris Sells and WPF guru Ian Griffiths,  is the book you need to get up to speed on WPF. By page two, you'll have written your first WPF application, and by the end of Chapter 1, "Hello WPF," you'll have completed a rapid tour of the framework and its major elements. These include the XAML markup language and the mapping of XAML markup to WinFX code; the WPF content model; layout; controls, styles, and templates; graphics and animation; and, finally, deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Programming Windows Presentation Foundation features:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Scores of C# and XAML examples that show you what it takes to get a WPF application up and running, from a simple "Hello, Avalon" program to a tic-tac-toe game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insightful discussions of the powerful new programming styles that WPF brings to Windows development, especially its new model for controls&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A color insert to better illustrate WPF support for 3-D, color, and other graphics effects&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A tutorial on XAML, the new HTML-like markup language for declaring Windows UI&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;An explanation and comparison of the features that support interoperability with Windows Forms and other Windows legacy applications&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next generation of Windows applications is going to blaze a trail into the unknown. WPF represents the best of the control-based Windows world and the content-based web world; it's an engine just itching to be taken for a spin. Inside, you'll find the keys to the ignition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated samples and change notes for the move from the February CTP to Beta 2 are now available from the example site:  &lt;a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/writing/avbook/"&gt;http://www.sellsbrothers.com/writing/&amp;#8203;avbook/&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Open Source for the Enterprise</title>
    <author>Dan Woods, Gautam Guliani</author>
    <subjects>
      <subject>COMPUTERS</subject>
      <subject>General</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open source software is changing the world of Information Technology. But making it work for your company is far more complicated than simply installing a copy of Linux. If you are serious about using open source to cut costs, accelerate development, and reduce vendor lock-in, you must institutionalize skills and create new ways of working. You must understand how open source is different from commercial software and what responsibilities and risks it brings. &lt;i&gt;Open Source for the Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; is a sober guide to putting open source to work in the modern IT department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Open source software is software whose code is freely available to anyone who wants to change and redistribute it. New commercial support services, smaller licensing fees, increased collaboration, and a friendlier platform to sell products and services are just a few of the reasons open source is so attractive to IT departments. Some of the open source projects that are in current, widespread use in businesses large and small include Linux, FreeBSD, Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, JBOSS, and Perl. These have been used to such great effect by Google, Amazon, Yahoo!, and major commercial and financial firms, that a wave of publicity has resulted in recent years, bordering on hype. Large vendors such as IBM, Novell, and Hewlett Packard have made open source a lynchpin of their offerings. Open source has entered a new area where it is being used as a marketing device, a collaborative software development methodology, and a business model.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book provides something far more valuable than either the cheerleading or the fear-mongering one hears about open source. The authors are Dan Woods, former CTO of TheStreet.com and a consultant and author of several books about IT, and Gautam Guliani, Director of Software Architecture at Kaplan Test Prep &amp;amp; Admissions. Each has used open source software for some 15 years at IT departments large and small. They have collected the wisdom of a host of experts from IT departments, open source communities, and software companies.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Open Source for the Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; provides a top to bottom view not only of the technology, but of the skills required to manage it and the organizational issues that must be addressed. Here are the sorts of questions answered in the book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why is there a "productization gap" in most open source projects?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can the maturity of open source be evaluated?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can the ROI of open source be calculated?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What skills are needed to use open source?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What sorts of open source projects are appropriate for IT departments at the beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert levels?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What questions need to be answered by an open source strategy?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What policies for governance can be instituted to control the adoption of open source?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What new commercial services can help manage the risks of open source?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do differences in open source licenses matter?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How will using open source transform an IT department?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Praise for &lt;i&gt;Open Source for the Enterprise&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Open Source has become a strategic business issue; decisions on how and
where to choose to use Open Source now have a major impact on the
overall direction of IT abilities to support the business both with
capabilities and by controlling costs. This is a new game and one
generally not covered in existing books on Open Source which continue to
assume that the readers are 'deep dive' technologists, &lt;i&gt;Open Source for the Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; provides everyone from business managers to technologists
with the balanced view that has been missing. Well worth the time to
read, and also worth encouraging others in your enterprise to read as well." ----Andy Mulholland - Global CTO Capgemini
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"&lt;i&gt;Open Source for the Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; is required reading for anyone working
with or looking to adopt open source technologies in a corporate
environment. Its practical, no-BS approach will make sure you're armed
with the information you need to deploy applications successfully (as
well as helping you know when to say "no"). If you're trying to sell open
source to management, this book will give you the ammunition you need.
If you're a manager trying to drive down cost using open source, this
book will tell you what questions to ask your staff. In short, it's a
clear, concise explanation of how to successfully leverage open source
without making the big mistakes that can get you fired." ----Kevin Bedell - founding editor of LinuxWorld Magazine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, computers just deal with numbers. They store letters and other characters by assigning a number for each one. There are hundreds of different encoding systems for mapping characters to numbers, but Unicode promises a single mapping. Unicode enables a single software product or website to be targeted across multiple platforms, languages and countries without re-engineering. It's no wonder that industry giants like Apple, Hewlett-Packard, IBM andMicrosoft have all adopted Unicode.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Containing everything you need to understand Unicode, this comprehensive reference from O'Reilly takes you on a detailed guide through the complex character world. For starters, it explains how to identify and classify characters - whether they're common, uncommon, or exotic. It then shows you how to type them, utilize their properties, and process character data in a robust manner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The book is broken up into three distinct parts. The first few chapters provide you with a tutorial presentation of Unicode and character data. It gives you a firm grasp of the terminology you need to reference various components, including character sets, fonts and encodings, glyphs and character repertoires.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The middle section offers more detailed information about using Unicode and other character codes. It explains the principles and methods of defining character codes, describes some of the widely used codes, and presents code conversion techniques. It also discusses properties of characters, collation and sorting, line breaking rules and Unicode encodings. The final four chapters cover more advanced material, such
as programming to support Unicode.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You simply can't afford to be without the nuggets of valuable information detailed in &lt;i&gt;Unicode Explained&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Possessing everything you need to grasp Unicode, this comprehensive reference takes you on a detailed guide through the complex character world. Learn how to identify and classify characters, utilize their properties, and process data in a robust manner. Other topics include collation and sorting, line breaking rules and Unicode encodings. Perfect for both beginning and seasoned programmers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is gaining a lot of attention these days, as more companies and individuals switch from standard telephone service to phone service via the Internet.  The reason is simple: A single network to carry voice and data is easier to scale, maintain, and administer.  As an added bonus, it's also cheaper, because VoIP is free of the endless government regulations and tariffs imposed upon phone companies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
VoIP is simply overflowing with hack potential, and &lt;i&gt;VoIP Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is the practical guide from O'Reilly that presents these possibilities to you.  It provides dozens of hands-on projects for building a VoIP network, showing you how to tweak and customize a multitude of exciting things to get the job done.  Along the way, you'll also learn which standards and practices work best for your particular environment.  Among the quick and clever solutions showcased in the book are those for:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;gauging VoIP readiness on an enterprise network
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;using SIP, H.323, and other signaling specifications
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;providing low-layer security in a VoIP environment
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;employing IP hardphones, analog telephone adapters, and softPBX servers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;dealing with and avoiding the most common VoIP deployment mistakes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In reality, &lt;i&gt;VoIP Hacks&lt;/i&gt; contains only a small subset of VoIP knowledge-enough to serve as an introduction to the world of VoIP and teach you how to use it to save money, be more productive, or just impress your friends.  If you love to tinker and optimize, this is the one technology, and the one book, you must investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing is as constant as change, and this is as true in enterprise computing as anywhere else. With the recent release of Java 2 Enterprise Edition 1.4, developers are being called on to add even greater, more complex levels of interconnectivity to their applications.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To do this, Java developers today need a clear understanding of how to apply the new APIs, use the latest open source Java tools, and learn the capabilities and pitfalls in Java 2 Enterprise Edition 1.4 -- so they can plan a technology and implementation strategy for new enterprise projects.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Fortunately, this is exactly what they get with the new &lt;i&gt;Java Enterprise in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, 3rd Edition. Because most integrated development environments (IDE) today include API lookup, we took out the main API sections from our previous edition to make room for new chapters, among others, on Ant, Cactus, Hibernate, Jakarta Struts, JUnit, security, XDoclet, and XML/JAXP.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Revised and updated for the new 1.4 version of Sun Microsystems Java Enterprise Edition software, &lt;i&gt;Java Enterprise in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, 3rd Edition is a practical guide for enterprise Java developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java and XML, 3rd Edition&lt;/i&gt;, shows you how to cut through all the hype about XML and put it to work.  It teaches you how to use the APIs, tools, and tricks of XML to build real-world applications.  The result is a new approach to managing information that touches everything from configuration files to web sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two chapters on XML basics, including XPath, XSL, DTDs, and XML Schema, the rest of the book focuses on using XML from your Java applications.  This third edition of &lt;i&gt;Java and XML&lt;/i&gt; covers all major Java XML processing libraries, including full coverage of the SAX, DOM, StAX, JDOM, and dom4j APIs as well as the latest version of the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) and Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB).  The chapters on web technology have been entirely rewritten to focus on the today's most relevant topics: syndicating content with RSS and creating Web 2.0 applications.  You'll learn how to create, read, and modify RSS feeds for syndicated content and use XML to power the next generation of websites with Ajax and Adobe Flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics include:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basics of XML, including DTDs, namespaces, XML Schema, XPath, and Transformations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SAX API, including all handlers, filters, and writers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DOM API, including DOM Level 2, Level 3, and the DOM HTML module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The JDOM API, including the core and a look at XPath support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The StAX API, including StAX factories, producing documents and XMLPull&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Binding with JAXB, using the new JAXB 2.0 annotations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web syndication and podcasting with RSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML on the Presentation Layer, paying attention to Ajax and Flash applications&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are developing with Java and need to use XML, or think that you will be in the future; if you're involved in the new peer-to-peer movement, messaging, or web services; or if you're developing software for electronic commerce, Java and XML will be an indispensable companion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by networking veteran with 20 years of experience, &lt;em&gt;Network Warrior&lt;/em&gt; provides a thorough and practical introduction to the entire network infrastructure, from cabling to the routers. What you need to learn to pass a Cisco certification exam such as CCNA and what you need to know to survive in the real world are two very different things. The strategies that this book offers weren 't on the exam, but they 're exactly what you need to do your job well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Network Warrior&lt;/em&gt; takes you step by step through the world of hubs, switches, firewalls, and more, including ways to troubleshoot a congested network, and when to upgrade and why. Along the way, you 'll gain an historical perspective of various networking features, such as the way Ethernet evolved. Based on the author 's own experience as well as those he worked for and with, Network Warrior is a Cisco-centric book, focused primarily on the TCP/IP protocol and Ethernet networks -- the realm that Cisco Systems now dominates. The book covers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The type of networks now in use, from LANs, WANs and MANs to CANs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;The OSI Model and the layers involved in sending data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hubs, repeaters, switches, and trunks in practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto negotiation and why it 's a common problem in network slowdowns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route maps, routing protocols, and switching algorithms in Cisco routers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resilient Ethernet -- how to make things truly redundant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco 6500 multi-layer switches and the Catalyst 3750 switch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telecom nomenclature -- why it 's different from the data world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T1 and DS3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firewall theory, designing access lists, authentication in Cisco devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server load balancing technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content switch module in action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing QOS and what QOS does not do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP design and subnetting made easy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The book also explains how to sell your ideas to management, how networks become a mess as a company grows, and why change control is your friend. &lt;em&gt;Network Warrior&lt;/em&gt; will help network administrators and engineers win the complex battles they face every day.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Visual Basic 2005 in a Nutshell</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft made Visual Basic into an object-oriented programming language, millions of VB developers resisted the change to the .NET platform.  Now, after integrating feedback from their customers and creating Visual Basic 2005, Microsoft finally has the right carrot.  Visual Basic 2005 offers the power of the .NET platform, yet restores the speed and convenience of Visual Basic.  Accordingly, we've revised the classic in a Nutshell guide to the Visual Basic language to cover the Visual Basic 2005 version and all of its new features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unlike other books on the subject, &lt;i&gt;Visual Basic 2005 in a Nutshell, 3rd Edition&lt;/i&gt; doesn't assume you're a novice.  It's a detailed, professional reference to the Visual Basic language-a reference that you can use to jog your memory about a particular language element or parameter.  It'll also come in handy when you want to make sure that there isn't some "gotcha" you've overlooked with a particular language feature.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The book is divided into three major parts: Part I introduces the main features and concepts behind Visual Basic programming; Part II thoroughly details all the functions, statements, directives, objects, and object members that make up the Visual Basic language; and Part III contains a series of helpful appendices.  Some of the new features covered include Generics, a convenient new library called My Namespace, and the operators used to manipulate data in Visual Basic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
No matter how much experience you have programming with Visual Basic, you want &lt;i&gt;Visual Basic 2005 in a Nutshell, 3rd Edition&lt;/i&gt; close by, both as a standard reference guide and as a tool for troubleshooting and identifying programming problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Newly updated, this classic detailed reference to the Visual Basic programming language has been reorganized to cover all the ins and outs of Visual Basic 2005, including new features like Generics, My Namespace, and operators.  An alphabetical reference to Visual Basic 2005 statements, procedures, functions, and objects makes sure you follow along.  Ideal for developers, programmers, and anyone learning VB as a first language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popularity of digital cameras continues to grow exponentially.  They are now more powerful, feature rich, and affordable--turning digital photography into a mainstream interest. And with Photoshop Elements, Adobe has created the most popular photo-editing program on the planet. Learning how to work Photoshop Elements and manage digital photos can be a challenge for anyone just getting started--from the hobbyist to the pro photographer. With the latest Photoshop Elements 4 update, Adobe delivers a powerful new program that provides photo editing and organizing functionality with improved performance. The updated version also includes new, more intuitive features that are streamlined and easier to use--when the photographer has the right learning tool in hand.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With &lt;i&gt;Photoshop Elements 4: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;, author Barbara Brundage has written the perfect digital photography guide. In a clear, easy-to-read format, the author provides step-by-step instruction so readers can learn what they need to do to edit their photos successfully and manage their collection. This new edition also includes more than a dozen downloadable images so readers can practice using the editing tools.  Readers will master useful editing techniques--from the most common to the advanced:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automatically correct red eye and skin tones
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select and extract complex objects with the Magic Selection Brush and The Magic Extractor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create photomontages
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Restore old photographs
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Post photos on the web
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage and archive an entire collection
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design a custom slide show with panning and zooming capabilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Once photographers learn how to edit their photos successfully, they'll also learn how to post them online or upload them to the Kodak EasyShare Gallery for use in creating personal mailing lists, post cards, calendars, and much more. &lt;i&gt;Photoshop Elements 4: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;, is for any photographer interested in learning the right editing techniques for producing and sharing beautiful digital photography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photoshop Elements 4: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; covers the Windows version of the software only. When we published the book, there was no Mac version of the software (as there is now), and for various reasons, we've been unable to update this edition to include the Mac version. Nonetheless, if you're on a Mac, you can use this book. Just substitute Command for Ctrl, and Option for Alt whenever you see keystroke shortcuts, and about 98 percent of the Editor functions will work the same. The sections on the Organizer only apply to Windows because the Mac version has no Organizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Photoshop Elements 4: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;, author Barbara Brundage has written the perfect digital photography guide that covers new features and techniques--for the most common editing solutions to the more advanced.

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;This easy-to-use introduction to Microsoft Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is ideal for developers who want to learn to build services on a company network or as part of an enterprise system. Built into Windows Vista and Longhorn, and available for Windows XP and Windows 2003, WCF provides a platform for service-oriented architecture (SOA) that enables secure and reliable communication among systems within an organization or across the Internet. With WCF, software developers can focus on their business applications and not the plumbing required to connect them. Furthermore, with WCF developers can learn a single programming API to achieve results previously provided by ASMX, Enterprise Services and .NET Remoting. Learning WCF removes the complexity of using this platform by providing detailed answers, explanations and code samples for the most common questions asked by software developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Windows Communication Foundation (or WCF, formerly code name "Indigo") provides a set of programming APIs that make it easy to build and consume secure, reliable, and transacted services. This platform removes the need for developers to learn different technologies such as ASMX, Enterprise Services and .NET Remoting, to distribute system functionality on a corporate network or over the Internet. The first truly service-oriented platform, WCF provides innovations that decouple service design and development from deployment and distribution - creating a more flexible and agile environment. WCF also encapsulates all of the latest web service standards for addressing, security, reliability and more.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leery of 800-page books that try to teach you everything about digital photography? You should be. Rather than delve into the nuances of efficient workflow, color management, or creating spectacular enhancements, these doorstop volumes tend to gloss over key information in an attempt to cover everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new book series, &lt;em&gt;Eddie Tapp on Digital Photography&lt;/em&gt;, is different. An award-winning photographer, Eddie is acknowledged as one of the premier trainers of digital imaging in the world, a highly sought-after expert who educates many corporations, studios and agencies. In this series, he brings his teaching experience to bear on technical issues in six focused and affordable books on digital photography that offer one topic per volume with answers that are quick to find when you need them most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first book, &lt;em&gt;Photoshop Workflow Setups: Eddie Tapp on Digital Photography&lt;/em&gt;, offers a step-by-step approach for configuring key areas of Adobe Photoshop CS2 to create an efficient, visually uncluttered workspace. Photoshop has so many different work areas and tools that it can become confusing or even intimidating for digital photographers to use in a production environment-whether you're a serious amateur or a working professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highly-visual, well-designed book presents Photoshop's vast collection of menus, palettes, and tools, showing you not only how they work, but how they should work for you and your specific needs. With his easygoing and authoritative style, Eddie demonstrates how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create an efficient workspace by using the "arrange" menu and setting the screen view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become familiar with palettes for layers, channels and paths; history and actions; color, swatches and styles; and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set preferences for file handling, guides and grids, memory and image cache, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customize keyboard shortcuts and menus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with Adobe Bridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Photoshop's selection, painting, graphics, and vector tools, among others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this title, &lt;em&gt;Eddie Tapp on Digital Photography&lt;/em&gt; will also focus on color management; advanced and professional production techniques; controlling digital color and tone; and creative enhancement techniques. We're thrilled that Eddie Tapp has finally agreed to publish books-and with O'Reilly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of books tell you how to buy and sell on eBay. But what if something goes horribly awry? Do you have to chalk it up to a "lesson learned," lick your wounds and move on? Not a chance. &lt;i&gt;Don't Get Burned on eBay&lt;/i&gt; offers relevant lessons based on real-life stories posted on eBay's Answer Center. With sharp, witty rhetoric, veteran eBay user Shauna Wright (co-founder of the popular web site &lt;a href="http://www.whowouldbuythat.com"&gt;WhoWouldBuyThat.com&lt;/a&gt;), shows eBay veterans and newcomers alike how to avoid those nasty scenarios, and how to pull themselves out of the muck if they've already fallen in.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Six entertaining (and hair-raising) chapters cover real problems that people have encountered with bidding, payment, shipping, packaging, dealing with other eBayers, and coping with the eBay system. This book is for anyone who's ever used eBay, because even veteran buyers and sellers often don't know the intricacies of eBay's and PayPal's rules. &lt;i&gt;Don't Get Burned on eBay&lt;/i&gt; will leave you well-informed and better protected from potential pitfalls. The book's extensive glossary and numerous in-depth sidebars also make the book useful to people who haven't yet taken the plunge into eBay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajax, or Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, exploded onto the
scene in the spring of 2005 and remains the hottest story among web
developers. With its rich combination of technologies, Ajax provides a
strong foundation for creating interactive web applications with XML or
JSON-based web services by using JavaScript in the browser to process
the web server response. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ajax Design Patterns&lt;/i&gt; shows you best
practices that can dramatically improve your web development projects.
It investigates how others have successfully dealt with conflicting
design principles in the past and then relays that information
directly to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patterns outlined in the book fall into four
categories:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foundational technology: Examines the raw technologies
required for Ajax development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Programming: Exposes techniques that developers have
discovered to ensure their Ajax applications are maintainable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Functionality and usability: Describes the types of user
interfaces you'll come across in Ajax applications, as well as the new
types of functionality that Ajax makes possible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Development: Explains the process being used to monitor,
debug, and test Ajax applications
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ajax Design Patterns&lt;/i&gt; will also get you up
to speed with core Ajax technologies, such as XMLHttpRequest, the DOM, and JSON.
Technical discussions are followed by code examples so you can see for
yourself just what is-and isn't-possible with Ajax. This handy
reference will help you to produce high-quality Ajax architectures,
streamline web application performance, and improve the user
experience.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael Mahemoff&lt;/b&gt; holds a PhD in Computer
Science and Software Engineering from the University of Melbourne, where his thesis
was "Design Reuse in Software Engineering and Human-Computer
Interaction." He lives in London and consults on software development
issues in banking, health care, and logistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Michael Mahemoff's &lt;i&gt;Ajax Design Patterns&lt;/i&gt;
is a truly comprehensive compendium of web
application design expertise, centred around but not limited to Ajax
techniques. Polished nuggets of design wisdom are supported
by tutorials and real-world code examples resulting in a book that
serves not only as an intermediate to expert handbook but also as an
extensive reference for building rich interactive web applications."&lt;br/&gt;
--Brent Ashley, remote scripting pioneer
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This handy reference reveals how Ajax patterns can vastly improve your web development projects. It does so by investigating how others have successfully dealt with conflicting design principles, and then relaying that information directly to you. Includes sections on foundational technology patterns, programming patterns, functionality and usability patterns, and diagnosis/testing of Ajax applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;Set up a web server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up networking, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tighten security on your SUSE system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor for intrusions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage software and upgrades smoothly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run multiple instances of SUSE on a single machine with Xen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Whether you use SUSE Linux from Novell, or the free openSUSE distribution, this book has something for every level of user. The modular, lab-based approach not only shows you how--but also explains why--and gives you the answers you need to get up and running with SUSE Linux.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About the author:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chris Brown&lt;/b&gt; is a freelance author and trainer in the United Kingdom and Europe. Following Novell's acquisition of SUSE, he taught Linux to Novell's consultants and IT staff and is certified in both Novell's CLP program and Red Hat's RHCE.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When developers build software, they're able to keep track of all the different versions and all the components they use with software configuration management (SCM) systems.  One of the more popular SCM products is Perforce.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Authored by Perforce's own VP of product technology, &lt;i&gt;Practical Perforce&lt;/i&gt; is the ideal complement to the existing product manual, focusing less on the 'how" and more on the "why" and "when."  The book is not only a helpful introduction to Perforce,
it's an enlightening resource for those already familiar with this versatile SCM product.   Whether you're a programmer, product manager, or build engineer, you stand to benefit from the many insider tips and ideas presented in this convenient guide.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Practical Perforce&lt;/i&gt; is divided into two main parts.  Part I offers a whirlwind technical tour, complete with careful descriptions of basic and advanced Perforce commands designed to give you a baseline knowledge.  Part II describes the big picture-using Perforce in a collaborative software development.  It outlines recommended best practices and quickly shows how to implement them with the Perforce operations introduced in Part I.  Throughout the book, you'll learn how to maximize Perforce so it completes tasks like these in the most efficient manner possible:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep track of changes as you conduct concurrent parallel work on files
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Log activity
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generate reports on who did what when
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compare, merge and branch files
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store files and file configurations
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Restore lost bug fixes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the pitfalls and practices of an SCM system like Perforce is absolutely essential to producing good software.  Now, with &lt;i&gt;Practical Perforce&lt;/i&gt;, you have the edge you need to ensure success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practical guide shows you how to make your Java web applications more responsive and dynamic by incorporating new Ajaxian features, including suggestion lists, drag-and-drop, and more. Java developers can choose between many different ways of incorporating Ajax, from building JavaScript into your applications "by hand" to using the new Google Web Toolkit (GWT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ajax on Java&lt;/em&gt; starts with an introduction to Ajax, showing you how to write some basic applications that use client-side JavaScript to request information from a Java servlet and display it without doing a full page reload. It also presents several strategies for communicating between the client and the server, including sending raw data, and using XML or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) for sending more complex collections of data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book then branches out into different approaches for incorporating Ajax, which include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Prototype and script.aculo.us Javascript libraries, the Dojo and Rico libraries, and DWR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating Ajax into Java ServerPages (JSP) applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Ajax with Struts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating Ajax into Java ServerFaces (JSF) applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Google's GWT, which offers a pure Java approach to developing web applications: your client-side components are written in Java, and compiled into HTML and JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajax gives web developers the ability to build applications that are more interactive, more dynamic, more exciting and enjoyable for your users. If you're a Java developer and haven't tried Ajax, but would like to get started, this book is essential. Your users will be grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make&lt;/i&gt; magazine, launched in February 2005 as the first magazine devoted to Tech DIY projects, hardware hacks, and DIY inspiration, has been hailed as "a how-to guide for the opposable thumb set" and "Popular Mechanics for the modern age."  Itching to build a cockroach-controlled robot, a portable satellite radio or your very own backyard monorail?  Hankering to hack a game boy or your circadian rhythms?  Rather read about people who fashion laptop bags from recycled wetsuits and build shopping cart go-karts?  &lt;i&gt;Make&lt;/i&gt; is required reading.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now, following on the heels of &lt;i&gt;Make&lt;/i&gt;'s wildly popular inaugural issues, O'Reilly offers &lt;i&gt;Makers&lt;/i&gt;, a beautiful hardbound book celebrating creativity, resourcefulness and the DIY spirit.  Author Bob Parks profiles 100 people and their homebrew projects-people who make ingenious things in their backyards, basements and garages with a lot of imagination and a little applied skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Makers&lt;/i&gt; features technologies old and new used in service of the serious and the amusing, the practical and the outrageous.  The makers profiled are driven by a combination of curiosity, passion and plain old stick-to-itiveness to create the unique and astonishing.  Most are simply hobbyists who'll never gain notoriety for their work, but that's not what motivates them to tinker.  The collection explores both the projects and the characters behind them, and includes full-color photographs and instructions to inspire weekend hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Parks is just the man to track the quirky and outlandish in their natural maker habitats.  A well-known journalist and author who covers the personalities behind the latest technologies, Parks' articles on innovations of all kinds have appeared in &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Outside&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Business 2.0&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Make&lt;/i&gt;.  He has contributed essays to "All Things Considered" on public radio and discussed trends in technology devices with Regis Philbin and Russ Mitchell on television.  As a &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt; editor, Parks directed coverage of new consumer technologies and contributed feature articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All those who love to tinker or who fancy themselves kindred DIY spirits will appreciate Parks' eclectic and intriguing collection of independent thinkers and makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've heard about Skype--and who hasn't with all the recent media attention devoted to internet telephone services--chances are you've been mighty tempted to try it out. &lt;i&gt;Skype Hacks&lt;/i&gt; tells you what all the Skype hype is about, explains the basics, and shows you more than 100 clever tips and tricks for tweaking and tuning Skype to make it do just what you want and more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Millions of people (48 million and counting, in fact) have opted for Skype, which uses peer-to-peer (P2P) technology to turn any PC, Mac, or Pocket PC into a telephone. Skype offers free calls between computers and extremely cheap calls to "old-fashioned" phone numbers (landlines and mobile phones). The sound quality is excellent, and end-to-end encryption means the connection is private and secure.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But if you really know what you're doing, Skype can accomplish a whole lot more than that. Software developer and author Andrew Sheppard recently converted his entire house to Skype and uses it for all his personal and business calls, even when he's traveling. In &lt;i&gt;Skype Hacks&lt;/i&gt;, he shows you how to do things with the technology that even the engineers at Skype probably never intended.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Skype Hacks&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get started with Skype
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Figure out how much money you're saving and maximize your savings
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cut the ties to your old phone company
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimize your Skype configuration
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrate Skype with desktop tools like Microsoft Office and your web browser
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set up a Skype-based call center&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book offers ideas for creating and organizing a contacts list, using Skype to transfer files, taking advantage of chat and voicemail capabilities, turning a PDA into a mobile phone, and automating Skype for even greater efficiency. So whether you'd simply like to give Skype a trial run, you want new Skype ring tones and fun on-hold music, or you're considering wiring your home with Skype to get rid of "regular" phone service altogether, &lt;i&gt;Skype Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is your ideal guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;If you've heard about Skype--and who hasn't with all the recent media attention devoted to internet phone service--chances are you've been mighty tempted to try it out. &lt;i&gt;Skype Hacks&lt;/i&gt; tells you what all the Skype hype is about, explains the basics, and shows you more than 100 clever tips and tricks for tweaking and tuning Skype so you too can enjoy free phone calls and services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;li&gt;Provides the complete ins and outs of changing a desktop's behavior, such as fonts, keyboard settings, and remote security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Includes articles on how to take advantage of X's "network transparency" -- its ability to display graphical applications on a remote machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explores intriguing areas such as using multiple monitors, building kiosks, and accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Features discussions on X Window innovations and the future of the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;X Power Tools&lt;/em&gt; covers configuration and use of X, focusing on Linux but also including notes on other operating systems such as Solaris and FreeBSD. Each article in the book gives you insight into X; the entire book gives you a real grasp on this system and what you can do with it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Fifth Edition is completely revised and expanded to cover JavaScript as it is used in today's Web 2.0 applications. This book is both an example-driven programmer's guide and a keep-on-your-desk reference, with new chapters that explain everything you need to know to get the most out of JavaScript, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scripted HTTP and Ajax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client-side graphics using the canvas tag&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Namespaces in JavaScript--essential when writing complex programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classes, closures, persistence, Flash, and JavaScript embedded in Java applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part I explains the core JavaScript language in detail. If you are new to JavaScript, it will teach you the language. If you are already a JavaScript programmer, Part I will sharpen your skills and deepen your understanding of the language.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part II explains the scripting environment provided by web browsers, with a focus on DOM scripting with unobtrusive JavaScript. The broad and deep coverage of client-side JavaScript is illustrated with many sophisticated examples that demonstrate how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Generate a table of contents for an HTML document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display DHTML animations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate form validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw dynamic pie charts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make HTML elements draggable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define keyboard shortcuts for web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Ajax-enabled tool tips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use XPath and XSLT on XML documents loaded with Ajax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part III is a complete reference for core JavaScript. It documents every class, object, constructor, method, function, property, and constant defined by JavaScript 1.5 and ECMAScript Version 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part IV is a reference for client-side JavaScript, covering legacy web browser APIs, the standard Level 2 DOM API, and emerging standards such as the XMLHttpRequest object and the canvas tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 300,000 JavaScript programmers around the world have made
this their indispensable reference book for building JavaScript applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"A must-have reference for expert JavaScript programmers...well-organized and detailed."&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The indispensable reference for JavaScript programmers since 1996,
&lt;i&gt;JavaScript: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt;, 5th Edition is completely revised
and expanded to cover JavaScript as it is used in today's Web 2.0

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perl is a versatile, powerful programming language used in a variety of disciplines, ranging from system administration to web programming to database manipulation. One slogan of Perl is that it makes easy things easy and hard things possible. &lt;i&gt;Intermediate Perl&lt;/i&gt; is about making the leap from the easy things to the hard ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally released in 2003 as &lt;i&gt;Learning Perl Objects, References, and Modules&lt;/i&gt; and revised and updated for Perl 5.8, this book offers a gentle but thorough introduction to intermediate programming in Perl. Written by the authors of the best-selling &lt;i&gt;Learning Perl&lt;/i&gt;, it picks up where that book left off. Topics include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Packages and namespaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;References and scoping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulating complex data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object-oriented programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing and using modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing Perl code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributing to CPAN&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the successful format of &lt;i&gt;Learning Perl&lt;/i&gt;, we designed each chapter in the book to be small enough to be read in just an hour or two, ending with a series of exercises to help you practice what you've learned. To use the book, you just need to be familiar with the material in &lt;i&gt;Learning Perl&lt;/i&gt; and have ambition to go further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perl is a different language to different people. It is a quick scripting tool for some, and a fully-featured object-oriented language for others. It is used for everything from performing quick global replacements on text files, to crunching huge, complex sets of scientific data that take weeks to process. Perl is what you make of it. But regardless of what you use Perl for, this book helps you do it more effectively, efficiently, and elegantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Intermediate Perl&lt;/i&gt; is about learning to use Perl as a programming language, and not just a scripting language. This is the book that turns the Perl dabbler into the Perl programmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Perl programmers need a clear roadmap for improving their skills. &lt;i&gt;Intermediate Perl&lt;/i&gt; teaches a working knowledge of Perl's objects, references, and modules -- all of which makes the language so versatile and effective. Written by the authors of the bestselling Llama book, &lt;i&gt;Learning Perl&lt;/i&gt;, this guide offers a gentle but thorough introduction to intermediate programming in Perl. Topics include packages and namespaces, references and scoping, manipulating complex data structures, writing and using modules, package implementation, and using CPAN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globe-trotting travelers have long resorted to handy, pocket-size dictionaries as an aid to communicating across the language barrier. Dan Pilone's &lt;i&gt;UML 2.0 Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; is just such an aid for on-the-go developers who need to converse in the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Use this book to decipher the many UML diagrams you'll encounter on the path to delivering a modern software system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Updated to cover the very latest in UML, you'll find coverage of the following UML 2.0 diagram types:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Class diagrams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Component diagrams*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sequence diagrams*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication diagrams*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timing diagrams*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interaction Overview diagrams*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package diagrams*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployment diagrams*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use case diagrams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Composite structure diagrams*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activity diagrams*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statechart diagrams*&lt;/li&gt;
* New or expanded coverage in this edition&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Also new in this edition is coverage of UML's Object Constraint Language (OCL). Using OCL, you can specify more narrowly the functionality described in a given diagram by recording limits that are the result of business rules and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;UML 2.0 Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; travels well to meetings and fits nicely into your laptop bag. It's near impossible to memorize all aspects of UML, and with this book along, you won't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a novice programmer and you want to learn C#, there aren't many books that will guide you. Most C# books are written for experienced C++ and Java programmers.
That's why Jesse Liberty, author of the best-selling books &lt;i&gt;Programming C#&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Programming ASP.NET&lt;/i&gt;, has written an entry-level guide to C#.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Written in a warm and friendly manner, &lt;i&gt;Learning C#&lt;/i&gt; assumes no prior programming experience, and provides a thorough introduction to Microsoft's premier .NET language. The book helps you build a solid foundation in .NET, and shows you how to apply your skills through the use of dozens of tested examples. You'll learn about the syntax and structure of the C# language, including operators, classes and interfaces, structs, arrays, and strings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Better yet, this updated edition of &lt;i&gt;Learning C#&lt;/i&gt; has been completely revised to include the latest additions to the C# language plus a variety of learning aids to help lock-in new knowledge and skills. Here's what's new:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extensive revisions to the text and examples to reflect C# 2005 and .NET 2.0 changes

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mac users everywhere--even those who know nothing about programming--are discovering the value of the latest version of AppleScript, Apple's vastly improved scripting language for Mac OS X Tiger. And with this new edition of the top-selling &lt;i&gt;AppleScript: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt;, anyone, regardless of your level of experience, can learn to use AppleScript to make your Mac time more efficient and more enjoyable by automating repetitive tasks, customizing applications, and even controlling complex workflows.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Fully revised and updated--and with more and better examples than ever--&lt;i&gt;AppleScript: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt; explores AppleScript 1.10 from the ground up. You will learn how AppleScript works and how to use it in a variety of contexts: in everyday scripts to process automation, in CGI scripts for developing applications in Cocoa, or in combination with other scripting languages like Perl and Ruby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
AppleScript has shipped with every Mac since System 7 in 1991, and its ease of use and English-friendly dialect are highly appealing to most Mac fans. Novices, developers, and everyone in between who wants to know how, where, and why to use AppleScript will find &lt;i&gt;AppleScript: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt; to be the most complete source on the subject available. It's as perfect for beginners who want to write their first script as it is for experienced users who need a definitive reference close at hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;AppleScript: The Definitive Guide, 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt; begins with a relevant and useful AppleScript overview and then gets quickly to the language itself; when you have a good handle on that, you get to see AppleScript in action, and learn how to put it into action for you. An entirely new chapter shows developers how to make your Mac applications scriptable, and how to give them that Mac OS X look and feel with AppleScript Studio. Thorough appendixes deliver additional tools and resources you won't find anywhere else. Reviewed and approved by Apple, this indispensable guide carries the ADC (Apple Developer Connection) logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, technology has become too much a part of overall corporate success for its effectiveness to be left to chance.  The stakes are too high.  Fortunately, the idea of 'quality management' is being reinvigorated. In the last decade process programs have become more and more prevalent.  And, out of all the available options, three have moved to the top of the chain.  These three are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 9001:2000 Quality Management Standard from the International Standards Organization;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Capability Maturity Model Integration from the Software Engineering Institute; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six Sigma, a methodology for improvement shaped by companies such as Motorola, Honeywell, and General Electric.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These recognized and proven quality programs are rising in popularity as more technology managers are looking for ways to help remove degrees of risk and uncertainty from their business equations, and to introduce methods of predictability that better ensure success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Process Improvement Essentials&lt;/i&gt; combines the foundation needed to understand process improvement theory with the best practices to help individuals implement process improvement initiatives in their organization. The three leading programs: ISO 9001:2000, CMMI, and Six Sigma--amidst the buzz and hype--tend to get lumped together under a common label.   This book delivers a combined guide to all three programs, compares their applicability, and then sets the foundation for further exploration.  It's a one-stop-shop designed to give you a working orientation to what the field is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Flash 8: Projects for Learning Animation and Interactivity</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macromedia Flash is fast becoming the Web's most widely used platform for creating rich media with animation and motion graphics, but mastering Flash isn't easy. Most entry-level books teach through simple examples that concentrate on either animation or scripting, but rarely both together. To get the most from Flash 8, you not only need to be proficient in programming/interface design, you need the creativity for story telling and the artistic insights to design fluid animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Flash 8: Projects for Learning Animation and Interactivity&lt;/i&gt; teaches Flash design rather than simply Flash itself. With a standalone series of walkthroughs and tutorials for Flash beginners coming from a graphics field, this book teaches Flash in the context of real-world projects. Rather than learn a Flash tool for the sake of it, you learn which areas of Flash are important, and which are less used, simply by seeing how typical content is actually created. And rather than a text-heavy approach, this graphically rich book leads you through hands-on examples by illustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each project in the book starts with goals and broad sketches before moving to design and scripting. This helps you understand design intent-the why of the process-rather than just learning the interfaces and the how of it all. Along the way, you'll create Flash content that includes traditional animation techniques (as seen in full-length animated features), and ActionScript-based interactive animation, such as custom web site interface designs. You also learn how to combine both traditional animation techniques and ActionScript to create feature-rich Flash assets from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Co-authored by educational developers with years of experience creating compelling content, interfaces, and applications, &lt;i&gt;Flash 8: Projects for Learning Animation and Interactivity&lt;/i&gt; offers a content-driven approach that is also inspiration-driven.  You learn because you're accomplishing something tangible, not because you think you need to know how a tool works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you want to understand how various features of Flash come together to create a final end design, this book provides you with both the insight and the know-how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book teaches Flash design rather than simply Flash itself. With a standalone series of walkthroughs and tutorials for Flash beginners coming from a graphics field,  Flash is covered in the context of real-world projects.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Sick of creating web sites that reload every time a user moves the mouse? Tired of servers that wait around to respond to users' requests for movie tickets? It sounds like you need a little (or maybe a lot of) Ajax in your life. Asynchronous programming lets you turn your own web sites into smooth, slick, responsive applications that make your users feel like they're back on the information superhighway, not stuck on a dial-up backroad.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But who wants to take on next-generation web programming with the last generation's instruction book? You need a learning experience that's as compelling and cutting-edge as the sites you want to design. That's where we come in. With &lt;i&gt;Head Rush Ajax&lt;/i&gt;, in no time you'll be writing JavaScript code that fires off asynchronous requests to web servers...and having fun doing it. By the time you've taken your dynamic HTML, XML, JSON,
and DOM skills up a few notches, you'll have solved tons of puzzles, figured out how well snowboards sell in Vail, and even watched a boxing match. Sound interesting? Then what are you waiting for? Pick up &lt;i&gt;Head Rush Ajax&lt;/i&gt; and learn Ajax and asynchronous programming the &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt; way--the way that sticks.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you've ever read a Head First book, you know what to expect: a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. Head Rush ramps up the intensity with an even faster look and feel. Have your first working app before you finish Chapter 1, meet up with the nefarious PROJECT: CHAOS stealth team, and even settle the question of the Top 5 Blues CDs of all time. Leave boring, clunky web sites behind with 8-tracks and hot pants--and get going with next-generation web programming.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"If you thought Ajax was rocket science, this book is for you. &lt;i&gt;Head Rush Ajax&lt;/i&gt; puts dynamic, compelling experiences within reach for every web developer."
-- Jesse James Garrett, Adaptive Path
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
"A 'technology-meets-reality' book for web pioneers on the cutting edge."

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;i&gt;We the Media&lt;/i&gt;, has become something of a bible for those who believe the online medium will change journalism for the better." -Financial Times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Big Media has lost its monopoly on the news, thanks to the Internet. Now that it's possible to publish in real time to a worldwide audience, a new breed of grassroots journalists are taking the news into their own hands. Armed with laptops, cell phones, and digital cameras, these readers-turned-reporters are transforming the news from a lecture into a conversation. In &lt;i&gt;We the Media&lt;/i&gt;, nationally acclaimed newspaper columnist and blogger Dan Gillmor tells the story of this emerging phenomenon and sheds light on this deep shift in how we make--and consume--the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Gillmor shows how anyone can produce the news, using personal blogs, Internet chat groups, email, and a host of other tools. He sends a wake-up call to
newsmakers-politicians, business executives, celebrities-and the marketers and PR flacks who promote them. He explains how to successfully play by the rules of this new era and shift from "control" to "engagement." And he makes a strong case to his fell journalists that, in the face of a plethora of Internet-fueled news vehicles, they must change or become irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Journalism in the 21st century will be fundamentally different from the Big Media oligarchy that prevails today. &lt;i&gt;We the Media&lt;/i&gt; casts light on the future of journalism, and invites us all to be part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dan Gillmor is founder of Grassroots Media Inc., a project aimed at enabling grassroots journalism and expanding its reach. The company's first launch is Bayosphere.com, a site "of, by, and for the San Francisco Bay Area."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dan Gillmor is the founder of the Center for Citizen Media, a project to enable and expand reach of grassroots media. From 1994-2004, Gillmor was a columnist at the &lt;i&gt;San Jose Mercury News&lt;/i&gt;, Silicon Valley's daily newspaper, and wrote a weblog for SiliconValley.com. He joined the &lt;i&gt;Mercury News&lt;/i&gt; after six years with the &lt;i&gt;Detroit Free Press&lt;/i&gt;. Before that, he was with the &lt;i&gt;Kansas City Times&lt;/i&gt; and several newspapers in Vermont. He has won or shared in several regional and national journalism awards. Before becoming a journalist he played music professionally for seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than three thousand feeds in the iPodder directory and at least ten more being added every day, podcasting is undeniably hot. &lt;i&gt;Podcasting Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; is a non-technical guide for the non-geek who wants in on this revolutionary new online medium--for those interested in enjoying the best podcasts or producing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While podcasts seem like Internet "radio programs," they are definitely not radio. And that's a very good thing for people like you with something to say. Radio waves, after all, are heavily regulated, which means you can't say whatever you want on them (in fact, most of you can't say anything on them, assuming you don't happen to be DJs). But anyone who can make an MP3 recording, host it on a web site, and publish a "feed" for it can be a podcaster. And anyone who wants access to opinions and ideas that you won't get on the radio can find them on a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Small enough to fit in your pocket, the portable and affordable &lt;i&gt;Podcasting Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to tune into the best podcasts and download them to your favorite portable device so you can listen to them wherever and whenever you want. This handy reference even includes a listener's guide with reviews of some of the most interesting and unusual podcasts available today. From unique views on current events to music you'd never hear otherwise to soundseeing tours that take you all over the world, there's something for everyone on virtually every conceivable topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For aspiring podcasters, &lt;i&gt;Podcasting Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; introduces you to the tools and techniques you'll need to make and publish podcasts with the most basic of equipment: a computer, a microphone, and some free software. It includes practical tips and how-tos for creating, recording, editing, and uploading your own, professional-quality podcast. Once you've made that first recording, you can publish it online, get it listed, and start obsessing over the size of your audience!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a listener or an aspiring podcaster, &lt;i&gt;Podcasting Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; is a non-technical guide for the non-geek who wants in on this revolutionary new medium. This handy guide shows you how to tune into unique and interesting podcasts and download them to your favorite portable device and contains an introduction to creating, recording, publishing, and finding an audience for your own, professional-quality podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As a consultant I was hired to review and evaluate eight of the top selling PMP Exam Preparation books for their accuracy in following the PMBOK&amp;#174; Guide - Third Edition.  I have developed and taught a PMP Exam Prep course for a leading R.E.P., and taught PMP Exam preparation classes for PMI Chapters.  I can honestly say that Head First PMP is by far the best PMP Exam Preparation book of all I have reviewed in depth. It is the very best basic education and training book that I have read that presents the processes for managing a project, which makes it a great resource for a basic project management class for beginners as well as a tool for practitioners who want to pass the PMP exam.  The graphical story format is unique, as project management books go, which makes it both fun and easy to read while driving home the basics that are necessary for preparing someone is just getting started and those who want to take the exam."

learn, pass the exam, and become a better project manager all at the same

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Teresa Simmermacher, PMP and Project Manager at Avanade&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I love this format! &lt;i&gt;Head First PMP&lt;/i&gt; covers everything you need to know to pass your PMP exam.  The sound-bite format combined with the whimsical images turns a dry subject into entertainment.  The organization starts with the basics then drills into the details.  The in-depth coverage of complex topics like Earned Value and Quality Control are presented in an easy to understand format with descriptions, pictures, and examples.  This book will not only help you pass the PMP, it should be used as an daily reference for practicing project managers.  I sure wish I had this when I was studying for the exam."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Mike Jenkins, PMP, MBA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"I think that under the fonts and formalized goofiness, the book has a good heart (intending to cover basic principles in an honest way rather than just to pass the test). &lt;i&gt;Head First PMP&lt;/i&gt; attempts to educate potential project managers instead of being a mere "how to pass the PMP exam" book filled with test taking tips. This is truly something which sets it apart from the other PMP certification exam books."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Jack Dahlgren, Project Management Consultant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"&lt;i&gt;Head First PMP&lt;/i&gt; is a great tool to help make sense of the Project Management Body of Knowledge for the everyday Project Manager."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Mark Poinelli, PMP
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Book&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A PMP certification is more than just passing a test. It means that you have the knowledge to solve most common project problems, and proves that you know your stuff. Once you're certified, your projects are more likely to succeed because you have the skills and knowledge to make them successful. Not only that, it can mean a better job, more money, and greater respect from your peers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
But studying for a difficult four-hour exam on project management isn't easy, even for experienced project managers. You want to remember everything that you're learning about project management, but your brain is working against you! Your brain craves novelty, and most PMP certification prep books are anything but novel. When you keep putting down a boring book instead of studying, it's because your brain doesn't think the information in it is worth learning. Your brain has more important stuff to think about, like how to keep you alive and out of danger-and it doesn't think that failing the PMP exam qualifies as life-threatening!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So how do you trick your brain into thinking that your life does depend on learning everything you need to know to pass the PMP Exam? &lt;i&gt;Head First PMP&lt;/i&gt; is the answer! Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science and learning theory, &lt;i&gt;Head First PMP&lt;/i&gt; has a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works-a multi-sensory experience that helps the material stick, not a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Head First PMP&lt;/i&gt; offers 100% coverage of The PMBOK&amp;#174; Guide principles and certification objectives in a way that's engaging, not tedious. This book helps you prepare for the PMP certification exam with a unique method that goes beyond answers to specific questions and makes you think about the big picture of project management. By putting project management concepts into context, you will be able to understand, remember, and apply them-not just on the exam, but also on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
With &lt;i&gt;Head First PMP&lt;/i&gt;, you get the best of both worlds: a thorough and effective preparation guide for the PMP certification exam with hundreds of practice questions and exam strategies, along with puzzles, games, problems, exercises and the unique Head First approach that makes learning easy and entertaining. When you're done with &lt;i&gt;Head First PMP&lt;/i&gt;, you'll know your stuff, you'll pass the exam, and you'll be able to bring everything you've learned to your job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Learn the tricks of the trade so you can build and architect applications that scale quickly--without all the high-priced headaches and service-level agreements associated with enterprise app servers and proprietary programming and database products. Culled from the experience of the Flickr.com lead developer, &lt;i&gt;Building Scalable Web Sites&lt;/i&gt; offers techniques for creating fast sites that your visitors will find a pleasure to use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Creating popular sites requires much more than fast hardware with lots of memory and hard drive space. It requires thinking about how to grow over time, how to make the same resources accessible to audiences with different expectations, and how to have a team of developers work on a site without creating new problems for visitors and for each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Presenting information to visitors from all over the world&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt; Integrating email with your web applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Planning hardware purchases and hosting options to have as much as you need without breaking your wallet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt; Partitioning and distributing databases to support large datasets and simultaneous transactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Monitoring your applications to find and clear bottlenecks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
* Providing services APIs and using services from other providers to increase your site's reach and capabilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Whether you're starting a small web site with hopes of growing big or you already have a large system that needs maintenance, you'll find &lt;i&gt;Building Scalable Web Sites&lt;/i&gt; to be a library of ideas for making things work.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive guide covers the design of software and hardware systems for web applications. Using scores of examples and leading-edge tips, it details proven methods for scaling web applications to millions of users. Topics include application architecture, development practices, technologies, Unicode, and general infrastructure work. Ideal for anyone ready to realize the cost and performance benefits available to web applications today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information Technology professionals can use this book to move beyond the excitement of web services and service oriented architecture (SOA) and begin the process of finding actionable ideas to innovate and create business value. In &lt;i&gt;Enterprise SOA: Designing IT for Business Innovation&lt;/i&gt;, SAP's blueprint for putting SOA to work is analyzed from top to bottom.  In addition to design, development, and architecture, vital contextual issues such as governance, security, change management, and culture are also explored. This comprehensive perspective reduces risk as IT departments implement ESA, a sound, flexible architecture for adapting business processes in response to changing market conditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book answers the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; What forces created the need for Enterprise Services Architecture?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does ESA enable business process innovation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is model-driven development used at all levels of design, configuration, and deployment?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do all the layers of technology that support ESA work together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will composite applications extend business process automation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does ESA create new models for IT governance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can companies manage disruptive change?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can enterprise services be discovered and designed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will the process of adapting applications be simplified?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on extensive research with experts from the German software company SAP, this definitive book is ideal for architects, developers, and other IT professionals who want to understand the technology and business relevance of ESA in a detailed way--especially those who want to move on the technology now, rather than in the next year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reference is a fascinating and complete guide to using fonts and typography on the Web and across a variety of operating systems and application software. &lt;em&gt;Fonts &amp;amp; Encodings&lt;/em&gt; shows you how to take full advantage of the incredible number of typographic options available, with advanced material that covers everything from designing glyphs to developing software that creates and processes fonts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The era of ASCII characters on green screens is long gone, and industry leaders such as Apple, HP, IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle have adopted the Unicode Worldwide Character Standard. Yet, many software applications and web sites still use a host of standards, including PostScript, TrueType, TeX/Omega, SVG, Fontlab, FontForge, Metafont, Panose, and OpenType. This book explores each option in depth, and provides background behind the processes that comprise today's "digital space for writing":
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part I introduces Unicode, with a brief history of codes and encodings including ASCII. Learn about the morass of the data that accompanies each Unicode character, and how Unicode deals with normalization, the bidirectional algorithm, and the handling of East Asian characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part II discusses font management, including installation, tools for activation/deactivation, and font choices for three different systems: Windows, the Mac OS, and the X Window System (Unix).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part III deals with the technical use of fonts in two specific cases: the TeX typesetting system (and its successor, W, which the author co-developed) and web pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part IV describes methods for classifying fonts: Vox, Alessandrini, and Panose-1, which is used by Windows and the CSS standard. Learn about existing tools for creating (or modifying) fonts, including FontLab and FontForge, and become familiar with OpenType properties and AAT fonts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Nowhere else will you find the valuable technical information on fonts and typography that software developers, web developers, and graphic artists need to know to get typography and fonts to work properly.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This reference is a fascinating and complete guide to using fonts and typography on the Web and across a variety of operating systems and application software. &lt;em&gt;Fonts &amp;amp; Encodings&lt;/em&gt; shows you how to take full advantage of the incredible number of typographic options available, with advanced material that covers everything from designing glyphs to developing software that creates and processes fonts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is your guide to building Internet applications and user interfaces with the Mozilla component framework, which is best known for the Firefox web browser and Thunderbird email client. &lt;em&gt;Programming Firefox&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates how to use the XML User Interface Language (XUL) with open source tools in the framework's Cross-Platform Component (XPCOM) library to develop a variety of projects, such as commercial web applications and Firefox extensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book serves as both a programmer's reference and an in-depth tutorial, so not only do you get a comprehensive look at XUL's capabilities--from simple interface design to complex, multitier applications with real-time operations--but you also learn how to build a complete working application with XUL. If you're coming from a Java or .NET environment, you'll be amazed at how quickly large-scale applications can be constructed with XPCOM and XUL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Topics in &lt;em&gt;Programming Firefox&lt;/em&gt; include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An overview of Firefox technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to the graphical elements that compose a XUL application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firefox development tools and the process used to design and build applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing an application with multiple content areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Resource Description Files, and how the Firefox interface renders RDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulating XHTML with JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Displaying documents using the Scalable Vector Graphics standard and HTML Canvas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The XML Binding Language and interface overlays to extend Firefox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing the next-generation forms interface through XForms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Firefox&lt;/em&gt; is ideal for the designer or developer charged with delivering innovative standards-based Internet applications, whether they're web server applications or Internet-enabled desktop applications. It's not just a how-to book, but a what-if exploration that encourages you to push the envelope of the Internet experience.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over two million registered Flickr users and counting have discovered the ease and fun of organizing their photo libraries, showing off their favorite pictures to the world, and securely sharing their private pictures with friends, family, or ad hoc groups. But Flickr's own plethora of intuitive menus, options, and features just scratches the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Flickr Hacks&lt;/i&gt; goes beyond the basics of storing, sorting, and sharing your photos to the much bigger playground of what's possible. Whether you're a beginner looking to manage your metadata and play with tags, or a programmer in need of a detailed reference of Flickr API methods, you'll find what you're looking for here. In addition to getting under the hood of some of the most popular third-party Flickr toys already in the wild, you'll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Post photos to your blog directly from your cameraphone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mash up your own photos or others' public pictures into custom mosaics, collages, sliding puzzles, slideshows, or ransom notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back up your Flickr library to your desktop, and save the comments too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set random desktop backgrounds and build your own Flickr screensaver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geotag your photos and map your contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download a list of photos and make a contact sheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your own Flickr-style tag cloud to visualize the frequency of common tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a color picker with a dynamic color wheel of Flickr photos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feed photos to your web site and subscribe to custom Flickr feeds using RSS&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packed with practical, freely available backup and recovery solutions for Unix, Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X systems -- as well as various databases -- this new guide is a complete overhaul of &lt;i&gt;Unix Backup &amp;amp; Recovery&lt;/i&gt; by the same author, now revised and expanded with over 75% new material.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Backup &amp;amp; Recovery&lt;/i&gt; starts with a complete overview of backup philosophy and design, including the basic backup utilities of tar, dump, cpio, ntbackup, ditto, and rsync.  It then explains several open source backup products that automate backups using those utilities, including AMANDA, Bacula, BackupPC, rdiff-backup, and rsnapshot. &lt;i&gt;Backup &amp;amp; Recovery&lt;/i&gt; then explains how to perform bare metal recovery of AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Mac OS, Solaris, VMWare, &amp;amp; Windows systems using freely-available utilities. The book also provides overviews of the current state of the commercial backup software and hardware market, including overviews of CDP, Data De-duplication, D2D2T, and VTL technology.  Finally, it covers how to automate the backups of DB2, Exchange, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL-Server, and Sybase databases  - without purchasing a commercial backup product to do so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For environments of all sizes and budgets, this unique book shows you how to ensure data protection without resorting to expensive commercial solutions. You will soon learn to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automate the backup of popular databases without a commercial utility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform bare metal recovery of any popular open systems platform, including your PC or laptop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize valuable but often unknown open source backup products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the state of commercial backup software, including explanations of CDP and data de-duplication software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access the current state of backup hardware, including Virtual Tape Libraries (VTLs)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building a gateway, firewall, and wireless access point on a Linux network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a VoIP server with Asterisk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure remote administration with SSH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building secure VPNs with OpenVPN, and a Linux PPTP VPN server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single sign-on with Samba for mixed Linux/Windows LANs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centralized network directory with OpenLDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network monitoring with Nagios or MRTG&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting acquainted with IPv6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up hands-free networks installations of new systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux system administration via serial console&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
And a lot more. Each recipe includes a clear, hands-on solution with tested code, plus a discussion on why it works. When you need to solve a network problem without delay, and don't have the time or patience to comb through reference books or the Web for answers, &lt;em&gt;Linux Networking Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; gives you exactly what you need.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

With iPhone use increasing in business networks, IT and security professionals face a serious challenge: these devices store an enormous amount of information. If your staff conducts business with an iPhone, you need to know how to recover, analyze, and securely destroy sensitive data. &lt;em&gt;iPhone Forensics&lt;/em&gt; supplies the knowledge necessary to conduct complete and highly specialized forensic analysis of the iPhone, iPhone 3G, and iPod Touch. This book helps you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine what type of data is stored on the device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break v1.x and v2.x passcode-protected iPhones to gain access to the device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a custom recovery toolkit for the iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interrupt iPhone 3G's "secure wipe" process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct data recovery of a v1.x and v2.x iPhone user disk partition, and preserve and recover the entire raw user disk partition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recover deleted voicemail, images, email, and other personal data, using data carving techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recover geotagged metadata from camera photos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover Google map lookups, typing cache, and other data stored on the live file system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extract contact information from the iPhone's database &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use different recovery strategies based on case needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And more. &lt;em&gt;iPhone Forensics&lt;/em&gt; includes techniques used by more than 200 law enforcement agencies worldwide, and is a must-have for any corporate compliance and disaster recovery plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Great for beginners -- even if you don't know object-oriented programming, you can learn from examples on the 'Net and be on your way very soon. You will be able to confidently build apps that rival the ones included by Apple itself."
-- Josh Content, iPhone Developer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Developers everywhere are eager to create applications for the iPhone, and many of them prefer the open source, community-developed tool chain to Apple's own toolkit. In this new edition of &lt;em&gt;iPhone Open Application Development&lt;/em&gt;, author Jonathan Zdziarski covers the latest version of the open toolkit -- now updated for Apple's iPhone 2.x software and iPhone 3G -- and explains in clear language how to create applications using Objective-C and the iPhone API.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Zdziarski, who cracked the iPhone code and built the first fully-functional application with the open toolkit, includes detailed recipes and complete examples for graphics and audio programming, games programming with the CoreSurfaces and CoreImage interfaces, working with iTunes, and using sensors. With the open toolkit and this book, you can build iPhone applications that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Display status bars, preference tables, and other standard elements of the iPhone user interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play pre-recorded files or program-generated sounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and write plain text files and HTML files, including pages from the Web, and control display elements, such as scrollbars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and respond to changes in orientation when the user turns the phone around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And more. The first edition of this book developed an instant following and became the center of a movement. The second edition of &lt;em&gt;iPhone Open Application Development&lt;/em&gt; will make this open source toolkit an indispensable part of iPhone application development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

The book focuses primarily on the use of free and open source Java Web Services technologies -- including Java SE 6 and Java EE 5 tools -- but you'll find tips for using commercially available tools as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Java SOA Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; will help you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Construct XML vocabularies and data models appropriate to SOA applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build real-world web services using the latest Java standards, including JAX-WS 2.1 and JAX-RS 1.0 for RESTful web services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate applications from popular service providers using SOAP, POX, and Atom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create service orchestrations with complete coverage of the WS-BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) 2.0 standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the reliability of SOAP-based services with specifications such as WS-Reliable Messaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deal with governance, interoperability, and quality-of-service issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The recipes in &lt;em&gt;Java SOA Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; will equip you with the knowledge you need to approach SOA as an integration challenge, not an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of CouchDB's creators show you how to use this document-oriented database as a standalone application framework or with high-volume, distributed applications. With its simple model for storing, processing, and accessing data, CouchDB is ideal for web applications that handle huge amounts of loosely structured data. That alone would stretch the limits of a relational database, yet CouchDB offers an open source solution that's reliable, scales easily, and responds quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CouchDB works with self-contained data that has loose or ad-hoc connections. It's a model that fits many real-world items, such as contacts, invoices, and receipts, but you'll discover that this database can easily handle data of any kind. With this book, you'll learn how to work with CouchDB through its RESTful web interface, and become familiar with key features such as simple document CRUD (create, read, update, delete), advanced MapReduce, deployment tuning, and more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the basics of document-oriented storage and manipulation
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interact with CouchDB entirely though HTTP using its RESTful interface
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Model data as self-contained JSON documents
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Handle evolving data schemas naturally
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Query and aggregate data in CouchDB using MapReduce views
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replicate data between nodes

This is not simply another design patterns book, or another software engineering treatise on the right and wrong way to do things. The authors think aloud as they work through their project's architecture, the tradeoffs made in its construction, and when it was important to break rules.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A classic O'Reilly title since 1993, &lt;em&gt;sendmail&lt;/em&gt; now covers Versions 8.10 through 8.14 of this email routing program, including dozens of new features, options, and macros. This edition also takes a more nuts-and-bolts approach than its predecessors. It includes both an administration handbook and a reference guide that provide you with clear options for installing, configuring and managing sendmail's latest versions and companion programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The sendmail program has withstood the test of time because of its ability to solve the mail-routing needs of all sites large or small, complex or simple. But it's also difficult to configure and even more difficult to understand. That's why this book has proven valuable since the dawn of email. With it, you will be able to configure the program to meet any need, so that you never again have to call in a sendmail guru to bail you out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;sendmail&lt;/em&gt; includes the following sections:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some Basics&lt;/b&gt; is especially useful for people new to the program. It covers the basic concepts underlying mail delivery and the roles sendmail plays in that delivery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Administration&lt;/b&gt; covers all aspects of handling sendmail, from downloading and installing new releases to managing mailing lists and aliases&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Configuration Reference&lt;/b&gt; contains a heavily cross-referenced guide for configuring and tuning sendmail. Every arcane detail of sendmail is listed alphabetically&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Appendices&lt;/b&gt; contain more detail about sendmail than you may ever need&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This edition also includes new material on SSL and AUTH and a new chapter on Mitlers. If you're interested in what has changed since the last edition, one appendix categorizes the many improvements of sendmail's intervening versions by chapter, complete with references to the appropriate sections and page numbers in the book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With &lt;em&gt;sendmail&lt;/em&gt;, system administrators, programmers, network engineers, and even inexperienced users will be able to match this challenging but necessary utility to the needs of their network.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How secure is your network? The best way to find out is to attack it. &lt;em&gt;Network Security Assessment&lt;/em&gt; provides you with the tricks and tools professional security consultants use to identify and assess risks in Internet-based networks-the same penetration testing model they use to secure government, military, and commercial networks. With this book, you can adopt, refine, and reuse this testing model to design and deploy networks that are hardened and immune from attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Network Security Assessment&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates how a determined attacker scours Internet-based networks in search of vulnerable components, from the network to the application level. This new edition is up-to-date on the latest hacking techniques, but rather than focus on individual issues, it looks at the bigger picture by grouping and analyzing threats at a high-level. By grouping threats in this way, you learn to create defensive strategies against entire attack categories, providing protection now and into the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Network Security Assessment&lt;/em&gt; helps you assess:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web services, including Microsoft IIS, Apache, Tomcat, and subsystems such as OpenSSL, Microsoft FrontPage, and Outlook Web Access (OWA)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web application technologies, including ASP, JSP, PHP, middleware, and backend databases such as MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Windows networking components, including RPC, NetBIOS, and CIFS services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;SMTP, POP3, and IMAP email services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;IP services that provide secure inbound network access, including IPsec, Microsoft PPTP, and SSL VPNs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unix RPC services on Linux, Solaris, IRIX, and other platforms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Various types of application-level vulnerabilities that hacker tools and scripts exploit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Assessment is the first step any organization should take to start managing information risks correctly. With techniques to identify and assess risks in line with CESG CHECK and NSA IAM government standards, &lt;em&gt;Network Security Assessment&lt;/em&gt; gives you a precise method to do just that.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Network Security Assessment&lt;/em&gt; provides you with the tricks and tools professional security consultants use to identify and assess risks in Internet-based networks-the same penetration testing model they use to secure government, military, and commercial networks.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready  to go to the next level with Rails? From examining the parts of Ruby that make this framework possible to deploying large Rails applications, &lt;em&gt;Advanced Rails&lt;/em&gt; offers you an in-depth look at techniques for dealing with databases, security, performance, web services and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Chapters in this book help you understand not only the tricks and techniques used within the Rails framework itself, but also how to make use of ideas borrowed from other programming paradigms. &lt;em&gt;Advanced Rails&lt;/em&gt; pays particular attention to building applications that scale -- whether "scale" means handling more users, or working with a bigger and more complex database. You'll find plenty of examples and code samples that explain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspects of Ruby that are often confusing or misunderstood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metaprogramming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to develop Rails plug-ins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different database management systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced database features, including triggers, rules, and stored procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to connect to multiple databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to use the Active Support library for generic, reusable functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security principles for web application design, and security issues endemic to the Web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When and when not to optimize performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why version control and issue tracking systems are essential to any large or long-lived Rails project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Rails&lt;/em&gt; also gives you a look at REST for developing web services, ways to incorporate and extend Rails, how to use internationalization, and many other topics. If you're just starting out with rails, or merely experimenting with the framework, this book is not for you. But if you want to improve your skills with Rails through advanced techniques, this book is essential.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the book for experienced Rails developers who want to go to the next level with this web development framework, with an in-depth look at techniques for dealing with databases, security, performance, web services and much more.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by members of the development team that maintains Subversion, this is the official guide and reference manual for the popular open source revision control technology. The new edition covers Subversion 1.5 with a complete introduction and guided tour of its capabilities, along with best practice recommendations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Version Control with Subversion&lt;/em&gt; is useful for people from a wide variety of backgrounds, from those with no previous version control experience to experienced system administrators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Subversion is the perfect tool to track individual changes when several people collaborate on documentation or, particularly, software development projects. As a more powerful and flexible successor to the CVS revision control system, Subversion makes life so much simpler, allowing each team member to work separately and then merge source code changes into a single repository that keeps a record of each separate version.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Inside the updated edition Version Control with Subversion, you'll find:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An introduction to Subversion and basic concepts behind version control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A guided tour of the capabilities and structure of Subversion 1.5&lt;/li&gt;
Guidelines for installing and configuring Subversion to manage programming, documentation, or any other team-based project
&lt;li&gt;Detailed coverage of complex topics such as branching and repository administration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced features such as properties, externals, and access control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A guide to best practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete Subversion reference and troubleshooting guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If you've never used version control, you'll find everything you need to get started. And if you're a seasoned CVS pro, this book will help you make a painless leap into Subversion.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to build applications that take full advantage of Windows Vista's new user interface capabilities, you need to learn Microsoft's Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). This new edition, fully updated for the official release of .NET 3.0, is designed to get you up to speed on this technology quickly. By page 2, you'll be writing a simple WPF application. By the end of Chapter 1, you'll have taken a complete tour of WPF and its major elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WPF is the new presentation framework for Windows Vista that also works with Windows XP. It's a cornucopia of new technologies, which includes a new graphics engine that supports 3-D graphics, animation, and more; an XML-based markup language, called XAML, for declaring the structure of your Windows UI; and a radical new model for controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second edition includes new chapters on printing, XPS, 3-D, navigation, text and documents, along with a new appendix that covers Microsoft's new WPF/E platform for delivering richer UI through standard web browsers -- much like Adobe Flash. Content from the first edition has been significantly expanded and modified. Programming WPF includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scores of C# and XAML examples that show you what it takes to get a WPF application up and running, from a simple "Hello, Avalon" program to a tic-tac-toe game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insightful discussions of the powerful new programming styles that WPF brings to Windows development, especially its new model for controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A color insert to better illustrate WPF support for 3-D, color, and other graphics effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tutorial on XAML, the new HTML-like markup language for declaring Windows UI
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An explanation and comparison of the features that support interoperability with Windows Forms and other Windows legacy applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;WPF represents the best of the control-based Windows world and the content-based web world. Programming WPF helps you bring it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to build applications that take full advantage of the new rich user interface capabilities of the .NET 3.0 Framework, you need to learn Microsoft's Windows Presentation Foundation. Fully updated for the release of .NET 3.0, this new edition will get you up to speed quickly. The new edition includes new chapters on printing, XPS, 3-D, navigation, text and documents, along with a new appendix that covers Microsoft's new Silverlight platform for delivering richer UI through standard web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bestselling book is now the standard guide to building phone systems with Asterisk, the open source IP PBX that has traditional telephony providers running scared! Revised for the 1.4 release of the software, the new edition of &lt;em&gt;Asterisk: The Future of Telephony&lt;/em&gt; reveals how you can save money on equipment and support, and finally be in control of your telephone system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If you've worked with telephony in the past, you're familiar with the problem: expensive and inflexible systems that are tuned to the vendor's needs, not yours. Asterisk isn't just a candle in the darkness, it's a whole fireworks show. Because Asterisk is so powerful, configuring it can seem tricky and difficult. This book steps you through the process of installing, configuring, and integrating Asterisk with your existing phone system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You'll learn how to write dialplans, set up applications including speech synthesis and voice recognition, how to script Asterisk, and much more -- everything you need to design a simple but complete system with little or no Asterisk experience, and no more than rudimentary telecommunications knowledge. The book includes:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new chapter on managing/administering your Asterisk system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new chapter on using Asterisk with databases &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coverage of features in Asterisk 1.4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new appendix on dialplan functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simplified installation chapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New simplified SIP configuration, including examples for several popular SIP clients (soft phones and IP telephones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revised chapters and appendicies reviewed and updated for the latest in features, applications, trends and best-practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Asterisk is revolutionizing the telecom industry, due in large part to the way it gets along with other network applications. While other PBXs are fighting their inevitable absorption into the network, Asterisk embraces it. If you need to take control of your telephony systems, move to Asterisk and see what the future of telecommunications looks like.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

&lt;li&gt;Medical and public health statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educational and psychological statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many introductory books on the subject, &lt;em&gt;Statistics in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt; doesn't omit important material in an effort to dumb it down. And this book is far more practical than most college texts, which tend to over-emphasize calculation without teaching you when and how to apply different statistical tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With &lt;em&gt;Statistics in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt;, you learn how to perform most common statistical analyses, and understand statistical techniques presented in research articles. If you need to know how to use a wide range of statistical techniques without getting in over your head, this is the book you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Need to learn statistics as part of your job, or looking for help to pass a statistics course? &lt;em&gt;Statistics in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt; is a clear and concise introduction and reference for anyone with no previous background in the subject. You get a firm grasp of the basics before moving into increasingly advanced material. Each chapter presents you with easy-to-follow descriptions illustrated by graphics, formulas, and plenty of solved examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you're well versed in ASP.NET, think again. This exceptional guide gives you a master class in site building with ASP.NET 3.5 and other cutting-edge Microsoft technologies. You learn how to develop rock-solid web portal applications that can withstand millions of hits every day while surviving scalability and security pressures -- not just for mass-consumer homepages, but also for dashboards that deliver powerful content aggregation for enterprises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Written by Omar AL Zabir, co-founder and CTO of Pageflakes, &lt;em&gt;Building a Web 2.0 Portal with ASP.NET 3.5&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates how to develop portals similar to My Yahoo!, iGoogle, and Pageflakes using ASP.NET 3.5, ASP.NET AJAX, Windows Workflow Foundation, LINQ and .NET 3.5.   Through the course of the book, AL Zabir builds an open source Ajax-enabled portal prototype (available online at &lt;i&gt;www.dropthings.com&lt;/i&gt;), and walks you though the design and architectural challenges, advanced Ajax concepts, performance optimization techniques, and server-side scalability problems involved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You learn how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement a highly decoupled architecture following the popular n-tier, widget-based application model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide drag-and-drop functionality, and use ASP.NET 3.5 to build the server-side part of the web layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use LINQ to build the data access layer, and Windows Workflow Foundation to build the business layer as a collection of workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build client-side widgets using JavaScript for faster performance and better caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get maximum performance out of the ASP.NET AJAX Framework for faster, more dynamic, and scalable sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a custom web service call handler to overcome shortcomings in ASP.NET AJAX 1.0 for asynchronous, transactional, cache-friendly web services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcome JavaScript performance problems, and help the user interface load faster and be more responsive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solve scalability and security problems as your site grows from hundreds to millions of users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy and run a high-volume production site while solving software, hardware, hosting, and Internet infrastructure problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Building a Web 2.0 Portal with ASP.NET 3.5&lt;/em&gt; also presents real-world ASP.NET challenges that the author has solved in building educational and enterprise portals, plus thirteen production disasters common to web applications serving millions of users. If you're ready to build state-of-the art, high-volume web applications, this book has exactly what you need.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;If you think you're well versed in ASP.NET, think again. This exceptional guide gives you a master class in site building with this framework. You learn how to develop rock-solid web portal applications similar to My Yahoo!, iGoogle, and Pageflakes using ASP.NET AJAX, Windows Workflow Foundation, LINQ, and .NET 3.5, along with ASP.NET 3.5 -- sites that can withstand millions of hits every day while surviving scalability and security pressures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building electronic projects that interact with the physical world is good fun. But when devices that you've built start to talk to each other, things really start to get interesting. Through a series of simple projects, you'll learn how to get your creations to communicate with one another by forming networks of smart devices that carry on conversations with you and your environment. Whether you need to plug some sensors in your home to the Internet or create a device that can interact wirelessly with other creations, &lt;em&gt;Making Things Talk&lt;/em&gt; explains exactly what you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book is perfect for people with little technical training but a lot of interest. Maybe you're a science teacher who wants to show students how to monitor weather conditions at several locations at once, or a sculptor who wants to stage a room of choreographed mechanical sculptures. &lt;em&gt;Making Things Talk&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates that once you figure out how objects communicate -- whether they're microcontroller-powered devices, email programs, or networked databases -- you can get them to interact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Each chapter in contains instructions on how to build working projects that help you do just that. You will:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make your pet's bed send you email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your own seesaw game controller that communicates over the Internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to use ZigBee and Bluetooth radios to transmit sensor data wirelessly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up communication between microcontrollers, personal computers, and web servers using three easy-to-program, open source environments: Arduino/Wiring, Processing, and PHP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write programs to send data across the Internet based on physical activity in your home, office, or backyard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
With a little electronics know-how, basic (not necessarily in BASIC) programming skills, a couple of inexpensive microcontroller kits and some network modules to make them communicate using Ethernet, ZigBee, and Bluetooth, you can get started on these projects right away. With &lt;em&gt;Making Things Talk&lt;/em&gt;, the possibilities are practically endless.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Through a series of simple projects, this book teaches you how to get your creations to communicate with one another by forming networks of smart devices that carry on conversations with you and your environment.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because RAW files remain virtually untouched by in-camera processing, working with them has given digital photographers greater flexibility and control during the editing process -- for those who are familiar enough with the format. Camera RAW, the plug in for Adobe Photoshop CS3, has emerged as one of the best and most familiar tools for editing RAW images, and the best way to master this workflow is with &lt;em&gt;Photoshop CS3 RAW&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Award-winning author Mikkel Aaland explores the entire RAW process, from the practical reasons to shoot RAW, to managing the images with the new features of Bridge 2.0 navigation software, to processing your images with the new power of Adobe Camera RAW 4 and Photoshop CS3. The book's unique four-color, photograph-rich design helps you grasp the subject through visual instruction and clear explanation.&lt;em&gt;Photoshop CS3 RAW&lt;/em&gt; focuses on Photoshop editing techniques, such as:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Automating RAW workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correcting exposures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extending exposure range&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulating grayscale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with the DNG open standard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Aaland helps you establish the best tool for each phase of your workflow, from managing shoots to perfecting photos. A digital photography pioneer and author of eight books, including O'Reilly's groundbreaking tutorial &lt;em&gt;Photoshop Lightroom Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, Aaland's trademark ability to teach complicated topics on digital imaging with straightforward, easy-to-follow text makes this book a valuable learning tool for anyone serious about digital photography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Required reading for professionals and dedicated photo hobbyists alike.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who says office cubicles need to be dreary? In this book, author Kaden Harris (creator of &lt;a href="http://www.eccentricgenius.ca"&gt;www.eccentricgenius.ca&lt;/a&gt;Eccentric Genius) introduces aspiring and die-hard Makers to a highly entertaining parallel universe of surreal office-based projects that are sure to pique the curiosity of even the most jaded office mates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
From desktop guillotines and crossbows to mood-enhancing effects and music makers, each project presents a different set of challenges and opens new avenues of Maker lore. There's a strong emphasis on the basic mechanical theories and principles of the devices presented in the book, as well as the fabrication techniques you need to use. But this is far more than a book of project "how-tos". &lt;em&gt;Eccentric Cubicle&lt;/em&gt; offers oblique industrial design and fabrication philosophies, countless cultural reference points, and innumerable bad puns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book is a dream come true for you office-bound souls who are tech DIY enthusiasts, hobbyist engineers/designers, and Makers at heart. Imagine having your cubicle sport projects such as:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A mechanical golfer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lucid dreaming induction device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USB-powered bubble blower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fog machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A desktop guillotine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a whole lot more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
In the &lt;em&gt;Eccentric Cubicle&lt;/em&gt;, Harris starts with classic, time-honored principals, then modernizes and augments his designs with performance enhancements and updated feature sets -- all while precariously balancing form, function, and oddness. Scavenging and repurposing materials and components at every opportunity, he challenges and inspires you to modify and adapt the projects and designs to meet your own scale, performance, and aesthetic requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Bring character and life to your office desktop with &lt;em&gt;Eccentric Cubicle&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;As you'd expect of Apple, the iPhone is gorgeous. iPhone: The Missing Manual is a book as breathtaking as its subject. Teeming with high-quality color graphics, each custom designed page helps you accomplish specific tasks -- everything from Web browsing to watching videos. Written by New York Times columnist and Missing Manual series creator David Pogue, this book shows you how to get the most out of your new Apple iPhone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The name iPhone may be doing Apple a disservice. This machine is so packed with possibilities that the cellphone may actually be the least interesting part. The iPhone is at least three products merged into one: a phone, a wide-screen iPod and a wireless, touch-screen Internet communicator. The iPhone's beauty alone may be enough for you to dig for your credit cards, but its Mac OS X-based software makes it not so much a smartphone as something out of the film "Minority Report."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The real magic, however, awaits when you browse the Web. You get to see the entire Web page on the iPhone's screen. All of this is cooked up with Apple's traditional secret sauce of simplicity, intelligence and whimsy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Written by New York Times columnist and Missing Manual series creator David Pogue, iPhone: The Missing Manual shows you everything they need to know to get the most out of your new Apple iPhone. Full of humor, tips, tricks, and surprises, this book teaches you how to extend iPhone's usefulness by exploiting its links to the Web as well as its connection to Macs or PCs; how to save money using Internet-based messages instead of phone calls; and how to fill the iPhone with TV shows and DVDs for free.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by members of the Apollo product team, this is the official guide to the Alpha release of Adobe Apollo, the new cross platform desktop runtime from Adobe Labs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apollo for Adobe Flex Developers Pocket Guide&lt;/em&gt; explains how to build and deploy Flash-based Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) to the desktop using Adobe's Flex framework. This book describes concisely how Apollo works, and offers numerous examples for those who want to start building RIAs for the desktop right away.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Why put RIAs on the desktop? They're already supposed to offer the responsiveness of desktop programs. Unfortunately, web browsers were designed to deliver and display HTML-based documents, not applications. The conflict between document- and application-focused functionality creates several problems when deploying applications via the browser.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Adobe Apollo gives you the best of both worlds -- the web development model and true desktop functionality. This pocket guide explains how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set up your development environment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create your first application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the File I/O API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use HTML within Flex-based Apollo applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the included Apollo mini-cookbook for common tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The book also includes a guide to Apollo packages, classes, and command-line tools. Once you understand the basics of building a Flex-based Apollo application, this pocket guide makes an ideal reference for tackling specific problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adobe Developer Library&lt;/b&gt; is a co-publishing partnership between O'Reilly Media and Adobe Systems, Inc. and is designed to produce the number one information resources for developers who use Adobe technologies. Created in 2006, the Adobe Developer Library is the official source for comprehensive learning solutions to help developers create expressive and interactive web applications that can reach virtually anyone on any platform. With top-notch books and innovative online resources covering the latest in rich Internet application development, the Adobe Developer Library offers expert training and in-depth resources, straight from the source.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Now you can build and deploy Flash-based Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) to the desktop using Adobe's Flex framework. Written by members of the Apollo product team, this is the official guide to the Alpha release of Adobe Apollo, the new cross platform desktop runtime from Adobe Labs. Numerous examples illustrate how Apollo works so you can start building RIAs for the desktop right away.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today's Web 2.0 world, JavaScript and Dynamic HTML are at the center of the hot new approach to designing highly interactive pages on the client side. With this environment in mind, the new edition of this book offers bite-sized solutions to very specific scripting problems that web developers commonly face. Each recipe includes a focused piece of code that you can insert right into your application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Why is &lt;em&gt;JavaScript &amp;amp; DHTML Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; so popular? After reading thousands of forum threads over the years, author and scripting pioneer Danny Goodman has compiled a list of problems that frequently vex scripters of various experience levels. For every problem he addresses, Goodman not only offers code, but a discussion of how and why the solution works. Recipes range from simple tasks, such as manipulating strings and validating dates in JavaScript, to entire libraries that demonstrate complex tasks, such as cross-browser positioning of HTML elements, sorting tables, and implementing Ajax features on the client.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Ideal for novices as well as experienced scripters, this book contains more than 150 recipes for:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with interactive forms and style sheets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Presenting user-friendly page navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating dynamic content via Document Object Model scripting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Producing visual effects for stationary content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioning HTML elements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with XML data in the browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Recipes in this Cookbook are compatible with the latest W3C standards and browsers, including Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 2, Safari, and Opera 9. Several new recipes provide client-side Ajax solutions, and many recipes from the previous edition have been revised to help you build extensible user interfaces for Web 2.0 applications. If you want to write your own scripts and understand how they work, rather than rely on a commercial web development framework, the &lt;em&gt;JavaScript &amp;amp; DHTML Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; is a must.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this compact book, Steven Feuerstein, widely recognized as one of the world's leading experts on the Oracle PL/SQL language, distills his many years of programming, teaching, and writing about PL/SQL into a set of best practices-recommendations for developing successful applications. Covering the latest Oracle release, Oracle Database 11gR2, Feuerstein has rewritten this new edition in the style of his bestselling &lt;em&gt;Oracle PL/SQL Programming&lt;/em&gt;. The text is organized in a problem/solution format, and chronicles the programming exploits of developers at a mythical company called My Flimsy Excuse, Inc., as they write code, make mistakes, and learn from those mistakes-and each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book offers practical answers to some of the hardest questions faced by PL/SQL developers, including:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the best way to write the SQL logic in my application code?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;How should I write my packages so they can be leveraged by my entire team of developers?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can I make sure that all my team's programs handle and record errors consistently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oracle PL/SQL Best Practices&lt;/em&gt; summarizes PL/SQL best practices in nine major categories: overall PL/SQL application development; programming standards; program testing, tracing, and debugging; variables and data structures; control logic; error handling; the use of SQL in PL/SQL; building procedures, functions, packages, and triggers; and overall program performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book is a concise and entertaining guide that PL/SQL developers will turn to again and again as they seek out ways to write higher quality code and more successful applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"This book presents ideas that make the difference between a successful project and one that never gets off the ground.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practical guide has exactly what you need to work with Windows Server 2008. Inside, you'll find step-by-step procedures for using all of the major components, along with discussions on complex concepts such as Active Directory replication, DFS namespaces and replication, network access protection, the Server Core edition, Windows PowerShell, server clustering, and more. All of this with a more compact presentation and a tighter focus on tasks than you'll find in bulkier references.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Server 2008: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; takes a refreshing approach. You won't find the history of Windows NT, or discussions on the way things used to work. Instead, you get only the information you need to use &lt;em&gt;this server&lt;/em&gt;. If you're a beginning or intermediate system administrator, you learn how the system works, and how to administer machines running it. The expert administrators among you discover new concepts and components outside of your realm of expertise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Simply put, this is the most thorough reference available for Windows Server 2008, with complete guides to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installing the server in a variety of different environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File services and the Windows permission structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the domain name system (DNS) works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active Directory, including its logical and physical structure, hierarchical components, scalability, and replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group Policy's structure and operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing security policy with predefined templates and customized policy plans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architectural improvements, new features, and daily administration of IIS 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal Services from both the administrator's user's point of view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking architecture including DNS, DHCP, VPN, RADIUS server, IAS, and IPSec&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows clustering services --- applications, grouping machines, capacity and network planning, user account management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows PowerShell scripting and command-line technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
With &lt;em&gt;Windows Server 2008: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt;, you to come away with a firm understanding of what's happening under the hood, but without the sense that you're taking a graduate course in OS theory. If you intend to work with this server, this is the only book you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Windows giving you pause? Ready to make the leap to the Mac instead? There has never been a better time to switch from Windows to Mac, and this incomparable guide will help you make a smooth transition. &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; columnist and Missing Manuals creator David Pogue gets you past three challenges: transferring your stuff, assembling Mac programs so you can do what you did with Windows, and learning your way around Mac OS X.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Why is this such a good time to switch? Upgrading from one version of Windows to another used to be simple. But now there's Windows Vista, a veritable resource hog that forces you to relearn everything. Learning a Mac is not a piece of cake, but once you do, the rewards are oh-so-much better. No viruses, worms or spyware. No questionable firewalls, inefficient permissions, or other strange features. Just a beautiful machine with a thoroughly reliable system. And if you're still using Windows XP, we've got you covered, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If you're ready to take on Mac OS X Leopard, the latest edition of this bestselling guide tells you everything you need to know:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transferring your stuff&lt;/b&gt; -- Moving photos, MP3s, and Microsoft Office documents is the easy part. This book gets you through the tricky things: extracting your email, address book, calendar, Web bookmarks, buddy list, desktop pictures, and MP3 files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Re-creating your software suite&lt;/b&gt; -- Big-name programs (Word, Photoshop, Firefox, Dreamweaver, and so on) are available in both Mac and Windows versions, but hundreds of other programs are available only for Windows. This guide identifies the Mac equivalents and explains how to move your data to them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learning Leopard&lt;/b&gt; -- Once you've moved into the Mac, a final task awaits: Learning your way around. Fortunately, you're in good hands with the author of &lt;em&gt;Mac OS X: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt;, the #1 bestselling guide to the Macintosh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Moving from Windows to a Mac successfully and painlessly is the one thing Apple does not deliver. &lt;em&gt;Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Leopard Edition&lt;/em&gt; is your ticket to a new computing experience.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

This fast-paced book gives you the basics of Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access so you can start using the new versions of these major Office applications right away.
Unlike every previous version, Office 2007 offers a completely redesigned user interface for each program. Microsoft has replaced the familiar menus with a new tabbed toolbar (or "ribbon"), and added other features such as "live preview" that lets you see exactly what each option will look like in the document before you choose it. This is good news for longtime users who never knew about some amazing Office features because they were hidden among cluttered and outdated menus.
Adapting to the new format is going to be a shock -- especially if you're a longtime user. That's where Office 2007: The Missing Manual comes in. Rather than present a lot of arcane detail, this quick &amp;amp; friendly primer teaches you how to work with the most-used Office features, with four separate sections covering the four programs. The book offers a walkthrough of Microsoft's redesigned Office user interface before taking you through the basics of creating text documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and databases with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clear explanations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step-by-step instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of illustrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plenty of friendly advice&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still the top-selling software suite for Mac users, Microsoft Office has been improved and enhanced to take advantage of the latest Mac OS X features. You'll find lots of new features in Office 2008 for Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Entourage, but not a page of printed instructions to guide you through the changes. &lt;em&gt;Office 2008 for Macintosh: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; gives you the friendly, thorough introduction you need, whether you're a beginner who can't do more than point and click, or a power user who's ready to tackle a few advanced techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
To cover Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Entourage, this guide gives you four superb books in one -- a separate section each for program! You can manage your day and create professional-looking documents, spreadsheets, and presentations in no time. Office 2008 has been redesigned so that the windows, toolbars, and icons blend in better with your other Mac applications. But there are still plenty of oddities. That's why this Missing Manual isn't shy about pointing out which features are gems in the rough -- and which are duds. With it, you'll learn how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigate the new user interface with its bigger and more graphic toolbars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Entourage separately or together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep track of appointments and manage daily priorities with the My Day feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create newsletters, flyers, brochures, and more with Word's Publishing Layout View&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build financial documents like budgets and invoices with Excel's Ledger Sheets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get quick access to all document templates and graphics with the Elements Gallery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize all of your Office projects using Entourage's Project Center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan or import digital camera images directly into any of the programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customize each program with power-user techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
With &lt;em&gt;Office 2008 for Macintosh: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt;, you get objective and entertaining instruction to help you tap into all of the features of this powerful suite, so you can get more done in less time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Though Office 2008 has been improved to take advantage of the latest Mac OS X features, you don't get a single page of printed instructions to guide you through the changes. &lt;em&gt;Office 2008 for Macintosh: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; gives you the friendly and thorough introduction you need, whether you're a beginner who can't do more than point and click, or a power user who's ready for a few advanced techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web 2.0 is more pervasive than ever, with business analysts and technologists struggling to comprehend the opportunity it represents. So what exactly is Web 2.0 -- a marketing term or technical reality? This fascinating book finally puts substance behind the phenomenon by identifying the core patterns of Web 2.0, and by introducing an abstract model and reference architecture to help you take advantage of them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In &lt;em&gt;Web 2.0 Architectures&lt;/em&gt;, authors Duane Nickull, Dion Hinchcliffe, and James Governor -- who have 40 years of combined experience with technical specifications and industry trends -- examine what makes successful Web 2.0 services such as Google AdSense, Flickr, BitTorrent, MySpace, Facebook, and Wikipedia work. The result is a base of knowledge that developers, business people, futurists, and entrepreneurs can understand and use as a source of ideas and inspiration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book reveals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Web 2.0 model:&lt;/b&gt; How the classic Client-Server model evolved into a more detailed Web 2.0 model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Web 2.0 reference architecture:&lt;/b&gt; A generic component view of basic Web 2.0 patterns that can be repurposed for other commercial ventures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Specific Web 2.0 patterns:&lt;/b&gt; How service oriented architecture (SOA), Software as a Service (SaaS), participation-collaboration, mashups, rich user experience, collaborative tagging systems (Folksonomy), and more can be used in your business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you want to understand what makes Web 2.0 tick, and how it will enhance your business, &lt;em&gt;Web 2.0 Architectures&lt;/em&gt; takes you right to the core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This fascinating book puts substance behind Web 2.0. Using several high-profile Web 2.0 companies as examples, authors Duane Nickull, Dion Hinchcliffe, and James Governor have distilled the core patterns of Web 2.0 coupled with an abstract model and reference architecture. The result is a base of knowledge that developers, business people, futurists, and entrepreneurs can understand and use as a source of ideas and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle is an enormous system, with myriad technologies, options, and releases. Most users-even experienced developers and database administrators-find it difficult to get a handle on the full scope of the Oracle database. And, as each new Oracle version is released, users find themselves under increasing pressure to learn about a whole range of new technologies. The latest challenge is Oracle Database 11g.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book distills an enormous amount of information about Oracle into a compact, easy-to-read volume filled with focused text, illustrations, and helpful hints. It contains chapters on:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oracle products, options, data structures, and overall architecture for Oracle Database 11g, as well as earlier releases (Oracle Database 10g, Oracle9i, and Oracle8i)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installing, running, managing, monitoring, networking, and tuning Oracle, including Enterprise Manager (EM) and Oracle's self-tuning and management capabilities; and using Oracle security, auditing, and compliance (a new chapter in this edition)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiuser concurrency, data warehouses, distributed databases, online transaction processing (OLTP), high availability, and hardware architectures (e.g., SMP, clusters, NUMA, and grid computing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Features beyond the Oracle database: Oracle Application Express, Fusion Middleware (including Oracle Application Server), and database SOA support as a Web services provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The latest Oracle Database 11g features: query result set caching, Automatic Memory Management, the Real Application Testing, Advanced Compression, Total Recall, and Active Data Guard Option Options, changes to the OLAP Option (transparently accessed and managed as materialized views), the Flashback transaction command, transparent data encryption, the Support Workbench (and diagnosability infrastructure), and partitioning enhancements (including interval and new composite types)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
For new Oracle users, DBAs, developers, and managers, &lt;em&gt;Oracle Essentials&lt;/em&gt; provides an invaluable, all-in-one introduction to the full range of Oracle features and technologies, including the just-released Oracle Database 11g features. But even if you already have a library full of Oracle documentation, you'll find that this compact book is the one you turn to, again and again, as your one-stop, truly essential reference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"&lt;em&gt;Oracle Essentials&lt;/em&gt; gives a clear explanation of the key database concepts and architecture underlying the Oracle database. It's a great reference for anyone doing development or management of Oracle databases."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enormous quantities of data go unused or underused today, simply because people can't visualize the quantities and relationships in it. Using a downloadable programming environment developed by the author, &lt;em&gt;Visualizing Data&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates methods for representing data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
How do the 3.1 billion A, C, G and T letters of the human genome compare to those of a chimp or a mouse? What do the paths that millions of visitors take through a web site look like? With &lt;em&gt;Visualizing Data&lt;/em&gt;, you learn how to answer complex questions like these with thoroughly interactive displays. We're not talking about cookie-cutter charts and graphs. This book teaches you how to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets with the help of a powerful new design and prototyping tool called "Processing".&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Used by many researchers and companies to convey specific data in a clear and understandable manner, the Processing beta is available free. With this tool and &lt;em&gt;Visualizing Data&lt;/em&gt; as a guide, you'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features that will bring users to your site over and over. This book teaches you:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The seven stages of visualizing data -- acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How all data problems begin with a question and end with a narrative construct that provides a clear answer without extraneous details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several example projects with the code to make them work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive and negative points of each representation discussed. The focus is on customization so that each one best suits what you want to convey about your data set&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The book does not provide ready-made "visualizations" that can be plugged into any data set. Instead, with chapters divided by types of data rather than types of display, you'll learn how each visualization conveys the unique properties of the data it represents -- why the data was collected, what's interesting about it, and what stories it can tell. &lt;em&gt;Visualizing Data&lt;/em&gt; teaches you how to answer questions, not simply display information.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;How you can take advantage of data that you might otherwise never use? With the help of the free software programming environment called Processing, this book helps you represent data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more. You'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-core chips from Intel and AMD offer a dramatic boost in speed and responsiveness, and plenty of opportunities for multiprocessing on ordinary desktop computers. But they also present a challenge: More than ever, multithreading is a requirement for good performance. This guide explains how to maximize the benefits of these processors through a portable C++ library that works on Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Unix systems. With it, you'll learn how to use Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) effectively for parallel programming -- without having to be a threading expert.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Written by James Reinders, Chief Evangelist of Intel Software Products, and based on the experience of Intel's developers and customers, this book explains the key tasks in multithreading and how to accomplish them with TBB in a portable and robust manner. With plenty of examples and full reference material, the book lays out common patterns of uses, reveals the gotchas in TBB, and gives important guidelines for choosing among alternatives in order to get the best performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You'll learn how Intel Threading Building Blocks:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enables you to specify tasks instead of threads for better portability, easier programming, more understandable source code, and better performance and scalability in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focuses on the goal of parallelizing computationally intensive work to deliver high-level solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is compatible with other threading packages, and doesn't force you to pick one package for your entire program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emphasizes scalable, data-parallel programming, which allows program performance to increase as you add processors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relies on generic programming, which enables you to write the best possible algorithms with the fewest constraints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Any C++ programmer who wants to write an application to run on a multi-core system will benefit from this book. TBB is also very approachable for a C programmer or a C++ programmer without much experience with templates. Best of all, you don't need experience with parallel programming or multi-core processors to use this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to learn C#? Programmers around the world have learned that C# lets them design great-looking programs and build them fast. With C#, you     ve got a powerful programming language and a valuable tool at your fingertips. And with the Visual Studio IDE, you     ll never have to spend hours writing obscure code just to get a button working. C#, Visual Studio and .NET take care of the grunt-work, and let you focus on the interesting parts of getting your programs written. Sound appealing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Unlike other C# books, which just show you examples and expect you to just memorize them and move on, &lt;em&gt;Head First C#&lt;/em&gt; gets you writing code from the beginning. You're given the tools you need, and then you're guided through fun and engaging programming projects. You'll build programs to play a card game, explore a house, and help lazy programmers manage their sick day excuses. But it's not all fun and games: you'll build business applications too, like a contact database and a program to help a party planner estimate her dinner parties. You'll build a dungeon role-playing game and a fully animated, colorful simulation of a beehive. And by the end of the book, you'll build a fast-paced, full-featured retro Invaders arcade game.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Make no mistake: by the time you're done with &lt;em&gt;Head First C#&lt;/em&gt;, you'll be able to build full-scale, complex, and highly visual programs. And you'll have all of the C# tools you need to tackle almost any programming problem that comes your way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head First C#&lt;/em&gt; is built for your brain, using the revolutionary approach that was pioneered by the highly acclaimed and popular Head First series. You'll never get that bored, "eyes glazed over" feeling from &lt;em&gt;Head First C#&lt;/em&gt;, because it guides you through one challenging project after another until, by the end of the book, you're a C# rock star!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Here's what you'll learn:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core C# programming concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use the Visual Studio 2008 IDE to build, debug and run your programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important .NET 3.5 features&lt;/b&gt;, including generic collections, Windows forms, GDI+ graphics, streams, serialization and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using object oriented programming concepts to help you build well-designed programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to build robust applications with good error handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The latest C# 3.0 features&lt;/b&gt;, including LINQ, object and collection initializers, automatic properties, extension methods and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Throughout the book, you'll confront and conquer advanced C# concepts. Some of the most mysterious ideas are demystified and explained with clear examples: how Unicode works, events and delegates, references versus value types, the stack versus the heap, what's really going on with garbage collection, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Thousands of readers have learned C# using this innovative book, including:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beginning programmers who want to learn programming from the ground up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More advanced programmers who are proficient in another language (like Visual Basic, Java, SQL, FoxPro) and want to add C# to their toolbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programmers who understand basic C# syntax, but are still looking to get a handle on how objects work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone who's tried to learn C#, but had to deal with books full of dull examples and nothing but boring console applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of people who just want to learn how to build cool games!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Head First C# is built to work with any version of Visual Studio 2008, including the free express edition. (It can also can be used with any version of Visual Studio 2005.)&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head First C#&lt;/em&gt; is a complete learning experience for object-oriented programming,  C#, and the Visual Studio IDE. Built for your brain, this book covers Visual C# 2008, Visual Studio 2008, and the .NET Framework 3.5, and teaches everything from language fundamentals to advanced topics including garbage collection, extension methods, and double-buffered animation. You'll also master C#'s hottest and newest syntax, LINQ, for querying your data in .NET collections, SQL databases, and more. By the time you're through, you'll be a proficient Visual C# programmer, designing and coding large-scale applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the tests you perform on web applications, security testing is perhaps the most important, yet it's often the most neglected. The recipes in the &lt;em&gt;Web Security Testing Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; demonstrate how developers and testers can check for the most common web security issues, while conducting unit tests, regression tests, or exploratory tests. Unlike ad hoc security assessments, these recipes are repeatable, concise, and systematic-perfect for integrating into your regular test suite.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Recipes cover the basics from observing messages between clients and servers to multi-phase tests that script the login and execution of web application features. By the end of the book, you'll be able to build tests pinpointed at Ajax functions, as well as large multi-step tests for the usual suspects: cross-site scripting and injection attacks. This book helps you:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obtain, install, and configure useful-and free-security testing tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand how your application communicates with users, so you can better simulate attacks in your tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose from many different methods that simulate common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and manipulating hidden form fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your tests repeatable by using the scripts and examples in the recipes as starting points for automated tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Don't live in dread of the midnight phone call telling you that your site has been hacked.  With &lt;em&gt;Web Security Testing Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; and the free tools used in the book's examples, you can incorporate security coverage into your test suite, and sleep in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

Backed by real-world examples, you'll find quick fixes for simple problems, in-depth answers for more complex situations, and complete solutions for applications with extensive problems. Learn to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine if and where you can expect performance gains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply quick fixes, such as limiting calls to the database in stored functions and procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor tasks, such as replacing application code by a stored procedure, or replacing iterative, procedural statements with sweeping SQL statements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor flow by increasing parallelism and switching business-inducted processing from synchronous to asynchronous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactor design using schema extensions, regular views, materialized views, partitioning, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compare before and after versions of a program to ensure you get the same results once you make modifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Refactoring SQL Applications&lt;/em&gt; teaches you to recognize and assess code that needs refactoring, and to understand the crucial link between refactoring and performance. If and when your application bogs down, this book will help you get it back up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;What can you do when database performance doesn't meet expectations? This book offers methods for refactoring (or changing) SQL code to improve performance without altering a database application's purpose -- and helps you do it on a shoestring budget. This isn't a rehash of theory, but a tested set of options for making code modifications to dramatically improve the way your applications function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember when an optimized website was one that merely didn't take all day to appear? Times have changed. Today, website optimization can spell the difference between enterprise success and failure, and it takes a lot more know-how to achieve success.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book is a comprehensive guide to the tips, techniques, secrets, standards, and methods of website optimization. From increasing site traffic to maximizing leads, from revving up responsiveness to increasing navigability, from prospect retention to closing more sales, the world of 21st century website optimization is explored, exemplified and explained.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Website Optimization&lt;/em&gt; combines the disciplines of online marketing and site performance tuning to attain the competitive advantage necessary on today's Web. You'll learn how to improve your online marketing with effective paid and natural search engine visibility strategies, strengthened lead creation and conversion to sales methods, and gold-standard ad copywriting guidelines. Plus, your increased site speed, reduced download footprint, improved reliability, and improved navigability will work synergistically with those marketing methods to optimize your site's total effectiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In this book for business and IT managers, author Andrew King, president of Website Optimization, LLC, has assembled experts in several key specialties to teach you:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Search engine optimization --&lt;/b&gt; addressing best (and worst) practices to improve search engine visibility, including step-by-step keyword optimization guidelines, category and tag cloud creation, and guerilla PR techniques to boost inbound links and improve rankings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pay-per-click optimization --&lt;/b&gt; including ad copywriting guidelines, setting profit-driven goals, calculating and optimizing bids, landing page optimization, and campaign management tips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optimizing conversion rates --&lt;/b&gt; increasing leads with site landing page guidelines, such as benefit-oriented copy, credibility-based design, value hierarchies, and tips on creating unique selling propositions and slogans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Web performance tuning --&lt;/b&gt; optimizing ways to use (X)HTML, CSS, and Ajax to increase speed, reduce your download footprint, and increase reliability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advanced tuning --&lt;/b&gt; including client-side techniques such as on-demand content, progressive enhancement, and inline images to save HTTP requests. Plus server-side tips include improving parallelism, using cache control, browser sniffing, HTTP compression, and URL rewriting to remap links and preserve traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Web metrics --&lt;/b&gt; illustrating the best metrics and tools to gather details about visitors and measure web conversion and success rates. Covering both search marketing metrics and web performance measures including Pathloss and waterfall graphs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Website Optimization&lt;/i&gt; not only provides you with a strategy for success, it also offers specific techniques for you and your staff to follow. A profitable website needs to be well designed, current, highly responsive, and optimally persuasive if you're to attract prospects, convert them to buyers, and get them to come back for more. This book describes precisely what you need to accomplish to achieve all of those goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Is your site easy to find, simple to navigate, and enticing enough to convert prospects into buyers? &lt;em&gt;Website Optimization&lt;/em&gt; shows you how. It reveals a comprehensive set of techniques to improve your site's performance by boosting search engine visibility for more traffic, increasing conversion rates to maximize leads and profits, revving up site speed to retain users, and measuring your site's effectiveness (before and after these changes) with best-practice metrics and tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you think that only professionals with expensive tools and years of experience can work with web graphics? This guide tosses that notion into the trash bin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Painting the Web&lt;/em&gt; is the first comprehensive book on web graphics to come along in years, and author Shelley Powers demonstrates how readers of any level can take advantage of the graphics and animation capabilities built into today's powerful browsers. She covers GIFs, JPEGs, and PNGs, raster and vector graphics, CSS, Ajax effects, the canvas objects, SVG, geographical applications, and more -- everything that designers (and non-designers) use to literally paint the Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
More importantly, Shelley's own love of web graphics shines through in every example. Not only can you master the many different techniques, you also can have fun doing it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Topics in &lt;em&gt;Painting the Web&lt;/em&gt; include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GIF, JPEG, PNG, lossy versus lossless compression, color management, and optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photo workflow, from camera to web page, including a review of photo editors, workflow tools, and RAW photo utilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tricks for best displaying your photos online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-photographic raster images (icons and logos), with step-by-step tutorials for creating popular "Web 2.0" effects like reflection, shiny buttons, inlays, and shadows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vector graphics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An SVG tutorial, with examples of all the major components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips and tricks for using CSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interactive effects with Ajax such as accordions and fades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The canvas object implemented in most browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geographical applications such as Google Maps and Yahoo Maps, with programming and non-programming examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual effects such as forms and data displays in table or graphics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web design for the non-designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graphics are not essential to the web experience, but they do make the difference between a site that's functional and one that's lively, compelling, and exciting. Whether you want to spruce up a website, use photos to annotate your stories, create hot graphics, or provide compelling displays for your data, this is the book for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it take to develop an enterprise application with Rails? &lt;i&gt;Enterprise Rails&lt;/i&gt; introduces several time-tested software engineering principles to prepare you for the challenge of building a high-performance, scalable website with global reach. You'll learn how to design a solid architecture that ties the many parts of an enterprise website together, including the database, your servers and clients, and other services as well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Many Rails developers think that planning for scale is unnecessary. But there's nothing worse than an application that fails because it can't handle sudden success. Throughout this book, you'll work on an example enterprise project to learn first-hand what's involved in architecting serious web applications.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With this book, you will:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tour an ideal enterprise systems layout: how Rails fits in, and which elements don't rely on Rails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to structure a Rails 2.0 application for complex websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover how plugins can support reusable code and improve application clarity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a solid data model -- a fortress -- that protects your data from corruption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base an ActiveRecord model on a database view, and build support for multiple table inheritance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore service-oriented architecture and web services with XML-RPC and REST&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See how caching can be a dependable way to improve performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Building for scale requires more work up front, but you'll have a flexible website that can be extended easily when your needs change. &lt;i&gt;Enterprise Rails&lt;/i&gt; teaches you how to architect scalable Rails applications from the ground up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Enterprise Rails is indispensable for anyone planning to build enterprise web services. It's one thing to get your service off the ground with a framework like Rails, but quite another to construct a system that will hold up at enterprise scale. The secret is to make good architectural choices from the beginning. Chak shows you how to make those choices. Ignore his advice at your peril."
-- Hal Abelson, Prof. of Computer Science and Engineering, MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this beautifully illustrated book, travel and adventure photographer Rick Sammon introduces the proven techniques he uses to make extraordinary photographs of people around the world. You'll find important tips and strategies for engaging your subject and setting up the shoot, along with techniques for shooting in a variety of conditions both indoors and outdoors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Rick Sammon is people person who loves the art of making -- rather than simply taking -- people pictures. In &lt;em&gt;Face to Face&lt;/em&gt;, he makes learning people photography a quick and enjoyable experience. Rick demonstrates his methods through a collection of his original photographs. Each photo includes notes explaining the principles he followed and the techniques he used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Face to Face&lt;/em&gt; offers hundreds of tips you can you for studio shoots and "environmental" people pictures, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outdoor techniques&lt;/b&gt; for shooting in low light, shooting in bright light, for capturing action, taking profiles, taking group shots, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Indoor techniques&lt;/b&gt; for using a flash and strobes, and for shooting silhouettes, working with mirrors, and other techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Photo philosophies and creative advice&lt;/b&gt;, such as developing a sense of place, carefully choosing the background, seeing pictures within a picture, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to photograph people in different cultures&lt;/b&gt;, along with fascinating behind-the-scenes stories of photos in the book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest section of the book, "Photo Philosophies", lays out several principles for making people pictures. Rick stresses that the camera looks both ways -- in other words, the attitude and energy you bring to a shoot will be reflected in a subject's face. If you're enthusiastic, you'll capture a picture that portrays enthusiasm. If you're impatient or distracted, that will be reflected as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Getting subjects to accept him in a matter of seconds is his prime goal as a people photographer -- after that, he says, taking pictures is much easier. Even if you're not a world traveler, Rick's tips and techniques will have you taking top-notch people pictures wherever you are.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Rick Sammon gives more than a dozen workshops and presentations each year, holds online classes, and is the producer of seven interactive DVDs for photographers on all facets of photography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Ready to transport your web applications into the Web 2.0 era? &lt;em&gt;Head First Rails&lt;/em&gt; takes your programming -- and productivity -- to the max. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals of Rails scaffolding to building customized interactive web apps using Rails' rich set of tools and the MVC framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
By the time you're finished, you'll have learned more than just another web framework. You'll master database interactions, integration with Ajax and XML, rich content, and even dynamic graphing of your data -- all in a fraction of the time it takes to build the same apps with Java, PHP, ASP.NET, or Perl. You'll even get comfortable and familiar with Ruby, the language that underpins Rails. But you'll do it in the context of web programming, and not through boring exercises such as "Hello, World!"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Your time is way too valuable to waste struggling with new concepts. Using the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory to craft a multi-sensory learning experience, &lt;em&gt;Head First Rails&lt;/em&gt; uses a visually rich format designed to take advantage of the way your brain really works.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajax is no longer an experimental approach to website development, but the key to building browser-based applications that form the cornerstone of Web 2.0. &lt;em&gt;Head First Ajax&lt;/em&gt; gives you an up-to-date perspective that lets you see exactly what you can do -- and has been done -- with Ajax. With it, you get a highly practical, in-depth, and mature view of what is now a mature development approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Using the unique and highly effective visual format that has turned Head First titles into runaway bestsellers, this book offers a big picture overview to introduce Ajax, and then explores the use of individual Ajax components -- including the JavaScript event model, DOM, XML, JSON, and more -- as it progresses. You'll find plenty of sample applications that illustrate the concepts, along with exercises, quizzes, and other interactive features to help you retain what you've learned. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head First Ajax&lt;/em&gt; covers:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The JavaScript event model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making Ajax requests with XMLHTTPREQUEST objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The asynchronous application model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Document Object Model (DOM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulating the DOM in JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling the browser with the Browser Object Model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XHTML Forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;POST Requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML Syntax and the XML DOM tree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML Requests &amp;amp; Responses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;JSON -- an alternative to XML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ajax architecture &amp;amp; patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Prototype Library&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book also discusses the server-side implications of building Ajax applications, and uses a "black box" approach to server-side components. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head First Ajax&lt;/em&gt; is the ideal guide for experienced web developers comfortable with scripting -- particularly those who have completed the exercises in &lt;em&gt;Head First JavaScript&lt;/em&gt; -- and for experienced programmers in Java, PHP, and C# who want to learn client-side programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among its many amazing applications, Google now has web-based alternatives to many of the applications in Microsoft Office. This comprehensive and easy-to-follow new book enables you to explore Google's new office applications in detail. Once you do, you'll be in good company -- more than 100,000 small businesses and some corporations are already looking to take advantage of these free Google offerings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Apps: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; teaches you how to use three relatively new applications from Google: "Docs and Spreadsheets", which provide many of the same core tools that you find in Word and Excel; and Google Calendar and Gmail, the applications that offer an alternative to Outlook. This book demonstrates how these applications together can ease your ability to collaborate with others, and allow you access to your documents, mail and appointments from any computer at any location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Of course, as remarkable as these applications are, Google's office suite is definitely a work-in-progress. Navigating what you can and can't do and -- more importantly -- understanding how to do it isn't always easy. And good luck finding enough help online. &lt;em&gt;Google Apps: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; is the one book you need to get the most out of this increasingly useful part of the Google empire. This book:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explains how to create, save and share each of Google's web-based office applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offers separate sections for Docs and Spreadsheets, Google Calendar, and Gmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrates how to use these applications in conjunction with one another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gives you crystal-clear and jargon-free explanations that will satisfy users of all technical levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Many of you already use Gmail, but do you know its full potential? Do you know how you can increase its power by using Gmail with Doc and Spreadsheets and Google Calendar? You'll find out with &lt;em&gt;Google Apps: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt;. You'll also come to understand why large corporations such as General Electric and Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble are taking a long, hard look at these applications.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive and easy-to-follow new book teaches you how to use the new web-based applications from Google that are providing a viable alternative to Microsoft Office for many businesses. While Google's office suite shows a lot of promise, navigating what you can and can't do and -- more importantly -- understanding how to do it isn't always easy. With this book, you can get the most out of Google's web-based business suite.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the success of its storefront and fulfillment services, Amazon now allows businesses to "rent" computing power, data storage and bandwidth on its vast network platform. This book demonstrates how developers working with small- to mid-sized companies can take advantage of Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as the Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Queue Service (SQS), Flexible Payments Service (FPS), and SimpleDB to build web-scale business applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With AWS, Amazon offers a new paradigm for IT infrastructure: use what you need, as you need it, and pay as you go. &lt;em&gt;Programming Amazon Web Services&lt;/em&gt; explains how you can access Amazon's open APIs to store and run applications, rather than spend precious time and resources building your own. With this book, you'll learn all the technical details you need to: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store and retrieve any amount of data using application servers, unlimited data storage, and bandwidth with the Amazon S3 service &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy computing time using Amazon EC2's interface to requisition machines, load them with an application environment, manage access permissions, and run your image using as many or few systems as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Amazon's web-scale messaging infrastructure to store messages as they travel between computers with Amazon SQS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage the Amazon FPS service to structure payment instructions and allow the movement of money between any two entities, humans or computers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create and store multiple data sets, query your data easily, and return the results using Amazon SimpleDB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale up or down at a moment's notice, using these services to employ as much time and space as you need&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Whether you're starting a new online business, need to ramp up existing services, or require an offsite backup for your home, &lt;em&gt;Programming Amazon Web Services&lt;/em&gt; gives you the background and the practical knowledge you need to start using AWS. Other books explain how to build web services. This book teaches businesses how to take make use of existing services from an established technology leader.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is an ideal language for solving problems, especially in Linux and Unix networks. With this pragmatic book, administrators can review various tasks that often occur in the management of these systems, and learn how Python can provide a more efficient and less painful way to handle them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Each chapter in &lt;em&gt;Python for Unix and Linux System Administration&lt;/em&gt; presents a particular administrative issue, such as concurrency or data backup, and presents Python solutions through hands-on examples. Once you finish this book, you'll be able to develop your own set of command-line utilities with Python to tackle a wide range of problems. Discover how this language can help you:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Read text files and extract information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run tasks concurrently using the threading and forking options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get information from one process to another using network facilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create clickable GUIs to handle large and complex utilities&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completely updated for C# 3.0 and the .NET 3.5 platform, the new edition of this bestseller offers more than 250 code recipes to common and not-so-common problems that C# programmers face every day. Every recipe in the book has been reconsidered with more than a third of them rewritten to take advantage of new C# 3.0 features. If you prefer solutions you can use today to general C# language instruction, and quick answers to theory, this is your book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;C# 3.0 Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; offers a new chapter on LINQ (language integrated query), plus two expanded chapters for recipes for extension methods, lambda functions, object initializers, new synchronization primitives and more. The new edition is also complemented by a public wiki, which not only includes all of the C# 2.0 recipes from the previous edition unchanged by the release of C# 3.0, but invites you to suggest better ways to solve those tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Here are some of topics covered:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;LINQ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numeric data types and Enumerations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strings and characters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classes and structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exception handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegates, events, and lambda expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filesystem interactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web site access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML usage (including LINQ to XML, XPath and XSLT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Structures &amp;amp; Algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Each recipe in the book includes tested code that you can download from oreilly.com and reuse in your own applications, and each one includes a detailed discussion of how and why the underling technology works. You don't have to be an experienced C# or .NET developer to use &lt;em&gt;C# 3.0 Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;. You just have to be someone who wants to solve a problem now, without having to learn all the related theory first.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This library is useful for practitioners, and is an excellent tool for those entering the field: it is a set of computer vision algorithms that work as advertised."&lt;br/&gt;
-William T. Freeman, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning OpenCV&lt;/em&gt; puts you in the middle of the rapidly expanding field of computer vision. Written by the creators of the free open source OpenCV library, this book introduces you to computer vision and demonstrates how you can quickly build applications that enable computers to "see" and make decisions based on that data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Computer vision is everywhere-in security systems, manufacturing inspection systems, medical image analysis, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and more. It stitches Google maps and Google Earth together, checks the pixels on LCD screens, and makes sure the stitches in your shirt are sewn properly. OpenCV provides an easy-to-use computer vision framework and a comprehensive library with more than 500 functions that can run vision code in real time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning OpenCV&lt;/em&gt; will teach any developer or hobbyist to use the framework quickly with the help of hands-on exercises in each chapter. This book includes:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A thorough introduction to OpenCV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting input from cameras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transforming images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segmenting images and shape matching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pattern recognition, including face detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracking and motion in 2 and 3 dimensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3D reconstruction from stereo vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Getting machines to see is a challenging but entertaining goal. Whether you want to build simple or sophisticated vision applications, &lt;em&gt;Learning OpenCV&lt;/em&gt; is the book you need to get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning OpenCV&lt;/em&gt; puts you right in the middle of the rapidly expanding field of computer vision. Written by the creators of OpenCV, the widely used free open-source library, this book introduces you to computer vision and demonstrates how you can quickly build applications that enable computers to "see" and make decisions based on the data.

    <title>Essential SQLAlchemy</title>
    <author>Rick Copeland</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Essential SQLAlchemy&lt;/em&gt; introduces a high-level open-source code library that makes it easier for Python programmers to access relational databases such as Oracle, DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. SQLAlchemy has become increasingly popular since its release, but it still lacks good offline documentation. This practical book fills the gap, and because a developer wrote it, you get an objective look at SQLAlchemy's tools rather than an advocate's description of all the "cool" features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
SQLAlchemy includes both a database server-independent SQL expression language and an object-relational mapper (ORM) that lets you map "plain old Python objects" (POPOs) to database tables without substantially changing your existing Python code. &lt;em&gt;Essential SQLAlchemy&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates how to use the library to create a simple database application, walks you through simple queries, and explains how to use SQLAlchemy to connect to multiple databases simultaneously with the same Metadata. You also learn how to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create custom types to be used in your schema, and when it's useful to use custom rather than built-in types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run queries, updates, and deletes with SQLAlchemy's SQL expression language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build an object mapper with SQLAlchemy, and understand the differences between this and active record patterns used in other ORMs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create objects, save them to a session, and flush them to the database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use SQLAlchemy to model object oriented inheritance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a declarative, active record pattern for use with SQLAlchemy using the Elixir extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the SQLSoup extension to provide an automatic metadata and object model based on database reflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, you'll learn how and when to use other extensions to SQLAlchemy, including AssociationProxy, OrderingList, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Essential SQLAlchemy&lt;/em&gt; is the much-needed guide for every Python developer using this code library. Instead of a feature-by-feature documentation, this book takes an "essentials" approach that gives you exactly what you need to become productive with SQLAlchemy right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ruby Programming Language&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; authoritative guide to Ruby and provides comprehensive coverage of versions 1.8 and 1.9 of the language. It was written (and illustrated!) by an all-star team:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Flanagan, bestselling author of programming language "bibles" (including &lt;em&gt;JavaScript: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Java in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt;) and committer to the Ruby Subversion repository.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, creator, designer and lead developer of Ruby and author of &lt;em&gt;Ruby in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt;, which has been expanded and revised to become this book.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;why the lucky stiff, artist and Ruby programmer extraordinaire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This book begins with a quick-start tutorial to the language, and then explains the language in detail from the bottom up: from lexical and syntactic structure to datatypes to expressions and statements and on through methods, blocks, lambdas, closures, classes and modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The book also includes a long and thorough introduction to the rich API of the Ruby platform, demonstrating -- with heavily-commented example code -- Ruby's facilities for text processing, numeric manipulation, collections, input/output, networking, and concurrency. An entire chapter is devoted to Ruby's metaprogramming capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ruby Programming Language&lt;/em&gt; documents the Ruby language definitively but without the formality of a language specification. It is written for experienced programmers who are new to Ruby, and for current Ruby programmers who want to challenge their understanding and increase their mastery of the language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Bestselling author David Flanagan teams up with Ruby creator Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto and writer/cartoonist/programmer why the lucky stiff to bring you &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; authoritative guide to Ruby. Covering versions 1.9 and 1.8, this book helps you learn Ruby's lexical structure, primary expressions, conditionals, syntax, classes, the data it manipulates, and more. For experienced programmers who want to look at this language in depth, this guide is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you consider yourself a pro or a hobbyist, you have to admit that Apple's iMovie 08 and iDVD 08 are amazing right out of the box. Unfortunately, the box doesn't include much of a user's guide, so learning about these applications is another matter. &lt;em&gt;iMovie 08 &amp;amp; iDVD: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; gets you up to speed on all of the themes, motion graphics, titles, effects -- everything that lets you turn raw digital footage into highly creative video projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You get crystal-clear and jargon-free explanations of all the iMovie 08 and iDVD 08 features, including the new video library, how to view transitions, titles, and sound in real time as you add them, and ways to publish your creations directly to YouTube. Renowned author David Pogue -- tech columnist for the New York Times -- uses an objective lens to scrutinize every step of process, including how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on multiple iMovie projects at once and drag &amp;amp; drop clips among them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output your creation to a blog, its own web page, or as a video podcast with iWeb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use "Magic iMovie" to import your video and make a movie for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate with other iLife programs to use songs, photos, and an original sound track&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a whole lot more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
From choosing and using a digital camcorder to burning the finished work onto DVDs, posting it online, or creating versions for iPod and iPhone, &lt;em&gt;iMovie 08 &amp;amp; iDVD: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; zooms right in on the details in a concise and understandable manner. The book also provides a firm grounding in basic film technique so that the quality of your video won't rely entirely on magic.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating robust software requires the use of efficient algorithms, but programmers seldom think about them until a problem occurs. &lt;em&gt;Algorithms in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt; describes a large number of existing algorithms for solving a variety of problems, and helps you select and implement the right algorithm for your needs -- with just enough math to let you understand and analyze algorithm performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With its focus on application, rather than theory, this book provides efficient code solutions in several programming languages that you can easily adapt to a specific project. Each major algorithm is presented in the style of a design pattern that includes information to help you understand why and when the algorithm is appropriate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With this book, you will:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solve a particular coding problem or improve on the performance of an existing solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly locate algorithms that relate to the problems you want to solve, and determine why a particular algorithm is the right one to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get algorithmic solutions in C, C++, Java, and Ruby with implementation tips&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the expected performance of an algorithm, and the conditions it needs to perform at its best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover the impact that similar design decisions have on different algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn advanced data structures to improve the efficiency of algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With &lt;em&gt;Algorithms in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt;, you'll learn how to improve the performance of key algorithms essential for the success of your software applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the Ajax-specific frameworks that have popped up in recent years, one clearly stands out as the industrial strength solution. Dojo is not just another JavaScript toolkit -- it's &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; JavaScript toolkit -- and &lt;em&gt;Dojo: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates how to tame Dojo's extensive library of utilities so that you can build rich and responsive web applications like never before. Dojo founder Alex Russell gives a foreword that explains the "why" of Dojo and of this book.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Dojo provides an end-to-end solution for development in the browser, including everything from the core JavaScript library and turnkey widgets to build tools and a testing framework. Its vibrant open source community keeps adding to Dojo's arsenal, and this book provides an ideal companion to Dojo's official documentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dojo: the Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; gives you the most thorough overview of this toolkit available, showing you everything from how to create complex layouts and form controls closely resembling those found in the most advanced desktop applications with stock widgets, to advanced JavaScript idioms to AJAX and advanced communication transports. With this definitive reference you get:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a concise introduction to Dojo that's good for all 1.x versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well-explained examples, with scores of tested code samples, that let you see Dojo in action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A comprehensive reference to Dojo's standard JavaScript library (including fundamental utilities in Base, Dojo's tiny but powerful kernel) that you'll wonder how you ever lived without&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An extensive look at additional Core features, such as animations, drag-and-drop, back-button handling, animations like wipe and slide, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exhaustive coverage of out-of-the-box Dijits (Dojo widgets) as well as definitive coverage on how to create your own, either from scratch or building on existing ones &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An itemized inventory of DojoX subprojects, the build tools, and the DOH, Dojo's unit-testing framework that you can use with Dojo -- or anywhere else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're a DHTML-toting web developer, you need to read this book -- whether you're a one-person operation or part of an organization employing scores of developers. Dojo packs the standard JavaScript library you've always wanted, and &lt;em&gt;Dojo: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; helps you transform your ideas into working applications quickly by leveraging design concepts you already know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The Dojo toolkit provides an end-to-end solution for development in the browser -- everything from its standard JavaScript library and turnkey widgets to build tools and a testing framework. This comprehensive guide to Dojo includes a hard-hitting reference to help you build rich and responsive web applications with complex layouts and form controls closely resembling those found in the most advanced desktop applications.

    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;Looking to study up for the new J2EE 1.5 Sun Certified Web Component Developer (SCWCD) exam? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book will get you way up to speed on the technology you'll know it so well, in fact, that you can pass the brand new J2EE 1.5 exam. If that's what you want to do, that is. Maybe you don't care about the exam, but need to use servlets and JSPs in your next project. You're working on a deadline. You're over the legal limit for caffeine. You can't waste your time with a book that makes sense only AFTER you're an expert (or worse, one that puts you to sleep).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Learn how to write servlets and JSPs, what makes a web container tick (and what ticks it off), how to use JSP's Expression Language (EL for short), and how to write deployment descriptors for your web applications. Master the c:out tag, and get a handle on exactly what's changed since the older J2EE 1.4 exam. You don't just pass the new J2EE 1.5 SCWCD exam, you'll understand this stuff and put it to work immediately.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Head First Servlets and JSP&lt;/i&gt; doesn't just give you a bunch of facts to memorize; it drives knowledge straight into your brain. You'll interact with servlets and JSPs in ways that help you learn quickly and deeply. And when you're through with the book, you can take a brand-new mock exam, created specifically to simulate the real test-taking experience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve success in today's ever-changing and unpredictable markets, competitive businesses need to rethink and reframe their strategies across the board. Instead of approaching new product development from the inside out, companies have to begin by looking at the process from the outside in, beginning with the customer experience. It's a new way of thinking-and working-that can transform companies struggling to adapt to today's environment into innovative, agile, and commercially successful organizations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Companies must develop a new set of organizational competencies: qualitative customer research to better understand customer behaviors and motivations; an open design process to reframe possibilities and translate new ideas into great customer experiences; and agile technological implementation to quickly prototype ideas, getting them from the whiteboard out into the world where people can respond to them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Subject to Change: Creating Great Products and Services for an Uncertain World&lt;/i&gt;, Adaptive Path, a leading experience strategy and design company, demonstrates how successful businesses can-and should-use customer experiences to inform and shape the product development process, from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This succinct book explains how you can apply the practices of Lean software development to dramatically increase productivity and quality. Based on techniques that revolutionized Japanese manufacturing, Lean principles are being applied successfully to product design, engineering, the supply chain, and now software development. With &lt;em&gt;The Art of Lean Software Development&lt;/em&gt;, you'll learn how to adopt Lean practices one at a time rather than taking on the entire methodology at once. As you master each practice, you'll see significant, measurable results. With this book, you will:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand Lean's origins from Japanese industries and how it applies to software development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the Lean software development principles and the five most important practices in detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distinguish between the Lean and Agile methodologies and understand their similarities and differences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine which Lean principles you should adopt first, and how you can gradually incorporate more of the methodology into your process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review hands-on practices, including descriptions, benefits, trade-offs, and roadblocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to sell these principles to management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Art of Lean Software Development&lt;/em&gt; is ideal for busy people who want to improve the development process but can't afford the disruption of a sudden and complete transformation. The Lean approach has been yielding dramatic results for decades, and with this book, you can make incremental changes that will produce immediate benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"This book presents Lean practices in a clear and concise manner so readers are motivated to make their software more reliable and less costly to maintain. I recommend it to anyone looking for an easy-to-follow guide to transform how the developer views the process of writing good software."
-- Bryan Wells, Boeing Intelligence &amp;amp; Security Sytems Mission System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"If you're new to Lean software development and you're not quite sure where to start, this book will help get your development process going in the right direction, one step at a time."
-- John McClenning, software development lead, Aclara&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For too long, developers have worked on disorganized application projects, where every part seemed to have its own build system, and no common repository existed for information about the state of the project. Now there's help. The long-awaited official documentation to Maven is here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Written by Maven creator Jason Van Zyl and his team at Sonatype, &lt;em&gt;Maven: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; clearly explains how this tool can bring order to your software development projects. Maven is largely replacing Ant as the build tool of choice for large open source Java projects because, unlike Ant, Maven is also a project management tool that can run reports, generate a project website, and facilitate communication among members of a working team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
To use Maven, everything you need to know is in this guide. The first part demonstrates the tool's capabilities through the development, from ideation to deployment, of several sample applications -- a simple software development project, a simple web application, a multi-module project, and a multi-module enterprise project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The second part offers a complete reference guide that includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The POM and Project Relationships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Build Lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project website generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced site generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build Profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Maven Repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team Collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing Plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, ands NetBeans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using and creating assemblies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing with Maven Archetypes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several sources for Maven have appeared online for some time, but nothing served as an introduction and comprehensive reference guide to this tool -- until now. &lt;em&gt;Maven: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; is the ideal book to help you manage development projects for software, web applications, and enterprise applications. And it comes straight from the source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harnessing Hibernate&lt;/em&gt; is an ideal introduction to the popular framework that lets Java developers work with information from a relational database easily and efficiently. Databases are a very different world than Java objects, and they often involve people with different skills and specializations. With Hibernate, bridging these two worlds is significantly easier, and with this book, you can get up to speed with Hibernate quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Rather than present you with another reference, &lt;em&gt;Harnessing Hibernate&lt;/em&gt; lets you explore the system, from download and configuration through a series of projects that demonstrate how to accomplish a variety of practical goals. The new edition of this concise guide walks you through Hibernate's primary features, which include mapping from Java classes to database tables, and from Java data types to SQL data types. You will also learn about Hibernate's data query and retrieval facilities, and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
By reading and following along with the examples, you can get your own Hibernate environment set up quickly and start using it for real-world tasks right away. &lt;em&gt;Harnessing Hibernate&lt;/em&gt; teaches you how to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perform Object/Relational mapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with persistent data from Java code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with groups and relationships between objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend Hibernate's rich type support for your own needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplify query creation using criteria and examples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and understand how it differs from SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Hibernate in conjunction with Spring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Hibernate in conjunction with other packages, such as the Stripes web framework and the Eclipse IDE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you're past the first few chapters, you can jump to topics that you find particularly interesting or relevant. All background material and explanations of how Hibernate works and why is in the service of a focused task. Source code can be downloaded from the book's website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
If using SQL is an uncomfortable chore, &lt;em&gt;Harnessing Hibernate&lt;/em&gt; offers you an effective and trouble-free method for working with the information you store in your applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>JavaScript: The Good Parts</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Considered &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In &lt;em&gt;JavaScript: The Good Parts&lt;/em&gt;, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inheritance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beautiful features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to &lt;em&gt;unlearn&lt;/em&gt; all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With &lt;em&gt;JavaScript: The Good Parts&lt;/em&gt;, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puzzles and brain twisters to keep your mind sharp and your memory intact are all the rage today. More and more people -- Baby Boomers and information workers in particular -- are becoming concerned about their gray matter's ability to function, and with good reason. As this sensible and entertaining guide points out, your brain is easily your most important possession. It deserves proper upkeep.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Brain: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; is a practical look at how to get the most out of your brain -- not just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the brain works, but how you can use it &lt;em&gt;more effectively&lt;/em&gt;. What makes this book different than the average self-help guide is that it's grounded in current neuroscience. You get a quick tour of several aspects of the brain, complete with useful advice about:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brain Food&lt;/b&gt;: The right fuel for the brain and how the brain commands hunger (including an explanation of the different chemicals that control appetite and cravings)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleep&lt;/b&gt;: The sleep cycle and circadian rhythm, and how to get a good night's sleep (or do the best you can without it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memory&lt;/b&gt;: Techniques for improving your recall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reason&lt;/b&gt;: Learning to defeat common sense; logical fallacies (including tactics for winning arguments); and good reasons for bad prejudices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creativity and Problem-Solving&lt;/b&gt;: Brainstorming tips and thinking not outside the box, but &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the box -- in other words, find the assumptions that limit your ideas so you can break through them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Understanding Other People's Brains&lt;/b&gt;: The battle of the sexes and babies developing brains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn about the built-in circuitry that makes office politics seem like a life-or-death struggle, causes you to toss important facts out of your memory if they're not emotionally charged, and encourages you to eat huge amounts of high-calorie snacks. With &lt;em&gt;Your Brain: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; you'll discover that, sometimes, you can learn to compensate for your brain or work around its limitations -- or at least to accept its eccentricities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Exploring your brain is the greatest adventure and biggest mystery you'll ever face. This guide has exactly the advice you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Brain: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; is a practical look at how to get the most out of your brain -- not just &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the brain works, but how you can use it &lt;em&gt;more effectively&lt;/em&gt;. What makes this book different than the average self-help guide is that it's grounded in current neuroscience. You get a quick tour of several aspects of the brain, complete with useful advice you can apply to everyday situations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clear, correct, and deep, this is a welcome addition to discussions of law and computing for anyone -- even lawyers!"
-- Lawrence Lessig, Professor of Law at Stanford Law School and founder of the Stanford Center for Internet and Society
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you work in information technology, intellectual property is central to your job -- but dealing with the complexities of the legal system can be mind-boggling. This book is for anyone who wants to understand how the legal system deals with intellectual property rights for code and other content. You'll get a clear look at intellectual property issues from a developer's point of view, including practical advice about situations you're likely to encounter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Written by an intellectual property attorney who is also a programmer, &lt;em&gt;Intellectual Property and Open Source&lt;/em&gt; helps you understand patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and licenses, with special focus on the issues surrounding open source development and the GPL. This book answers questions such as:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do open source and intellectual property work together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the most important intellectual property-related issues when starting a business or open source project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How should you handle copyright, licensing and other issues when accepting a patch from another developer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you pursue your own ideas while working for someone else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What parts of a patent should be reviewed to see if it applies to your work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When is your idea a trade secret?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you reverse engineer a product without getting into trouble?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should you think about when choosing an open source license for your project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Most legal sources are too scattered, too arcane, and too hard to read. &lt;em&gt;Intellectual Property and Open Source&lt;/em&gt; is a friendly, easy-to-follow overview of the law that programmers, system administrators, graphic designers, and many others will find essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is a guide to the legal system-without the legalese. From trade secrets to open source, this book offers a clear and understandable approach to intellectual property issues from a developer's point of view. Written by an intellectual property attorney who is also a programmer, &lt;em&gt;Intellectual Property and Open Source&lt;/em&gt; delivers an engrossing survey of the legal landscape and practical advice about situations you're likely to encounter when working on open source projects and pursuing new business ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the ingredients of robust, elegant, flexible, and maintainable software architecture? &lt;em&gt;Beautiful Architecture&lt;/em&gt; answers this question through a collection of intriguing essays from more than a dozen of today's leading software designers and architects. In each essay, contributors present a notable software architecture, and analyze what makes it innovative and ideal for its purpose. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Some of the engineers in this book reveal how they developed a specific project, including decisions they faced and tradeoffs they made. Others take a step back to investigate how certain architectural aspects have influenced computing as a whole. With this book, you'll discover:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How Facebook's architecture is the basis for a data-centric application ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effect of Xen's well-designed architecture on the way operating systems evolve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How community processes within the KDE project help software architectures evolve from rough sketches to beautiful systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How creeping featurism has helped GNU Emacs gain unanticipated functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The magic behind the Jikes RVM self-optimizable, self-hosting runtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design choices and building blocks that made Tandem the choice platform in high-availability environments for over two decades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differences and similarities between object-oriented and functional architectural views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How architectures can affect the software's evolution and the developers' engagement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop Policies: define rules, regulations, and monitoring criteria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know Your Network: build knowledge of your infrastructure with network telemetry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Your Targets: define the subset of infrastructure to be monitored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose Event Sources: identify event types needed to discover policy violations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feed and Tune: collect data, generate alerts, and tune systems using contextual information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain Dependable Event Sources: prevent critical gaps in collecting and monitoring events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Security Monitoring&lt;/em&gt; illustrates these steps with detailed examples that will help you learn to select and deploy the best techniques for monitoring your own enterprise network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you doing all you can to further your career as a software developer? With today's rapidly changing and ever-expanding technologies, being successful requires more than technical expertise. To grow professionally, you also need soft skills and effective learning techniques. Honing those skills is what this book is all about. Authors Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye have cataloged dozens of behavior patterns to help you perfect essential aspects of your craft.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Compiled from years of research, many interviews, and feedback from O'Reilly's online forum, these patterns address difficult situations that programmers, administrators, and DBAs face every day. And it's not just about financial success. &lt;i&gt;Apprenticeship Patterns&lt;/i&gt; also approaches software development as a means to personal fulfillment. Discover how this book can help you make the best of both your life and your career. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Solutions to some common obstacles that this book explores in-depth include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Burned out at work? "Nurture Your Passion" by finding a pet project to rediscover the joy of problem solving.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling overwhelmed by new information? Re-explore familiar territory by building something you've built before, then use "Retreat into Competence" to move forward again.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stuck in your learning? Seek a team of experienced and talented developers with whom you can "Be the Worst" for a while.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Brilliant stuff! Reading this book was like being in a time machine that pulled me back to those key learning moments in my career as a professional software developer and, instead of having to learn best practices the hard way, I had a guru sitting on my shoulder guiding me every step towards master craftsmanship. I'll certainly be recommending this book to clients. I wish I had this book 14 years ago!"

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get ahead in this new era of interaction design, this is the reference you need. Nintendo's Wii and Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch have made gestural interfaces popular, but until now there's been no complete source of information about the technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Designing Gestural Interfaces&lt;/em&gt; provides you with essential information about kinesiology, sensors, ergonomics, physical computing, touchscreen technology, and new interface patterns -- all you need to know to augment your existing skills in "traditional" web design, software, or product development. Packed with informative illustrations and photos, this book helps you:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get an overview of technologies surrounding touchscreens and interactive environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the process of designing gestural interfaces, from documentation to prototyping to&lt;/li&gt; communicating to the audience what the product does
&lt;li&gt;Examine current patterns and trends in touchscreen and gestural design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about the techniques used by practicing designers and developers today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See how other designers have solved interface challenges in the past&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at future trends in this rapidly evolving field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Only six years ago, the gestural interfaces introduced in the film &lt;em&gt;Minority Report&lt;/em&gt; were science fiction. Now, because of technological, social, and market forces, we see similar interfaces deployed everywhere. &lt;em&gt;Designing Gestural Interfaces&lt;/em&gt; will help you enter this new world of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Visual Basic was merged into .NET, it's become the core language for creating business applications with Windows. The latest version, VB 2008, is even more useful -- and provides even more incentive for migrating from VB 6. All it lacks is a good book on how to harness its power. &lt;em&gt;Programming Visual Basic 2008&lt;/em&gt; fills the void. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Written in a lively and engaging style by a developer who's grown up with Visual Basic, including both VB 6 and VB .NET, this hands-on guide addresses the core topics of the new VB, from basic to complex, with plenty of code examples. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Visual Basic 2008&lt;/em&gt; also examines .NET programming from the application level with a chapter-by-chapter plan for developing, documenting, and deploying a full data-driven application. You learn, step-by-step, how to build and deploy a library management system, complete with patron, inventory, and barcode support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The book's broad range of topics include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;VB language and its syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An overview of the .NET Framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object-oriented development in VB and .NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generic objects, collections, and nullable types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and management of software projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrating desktop features with Windows Forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database design with SQL Server 2008 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database interface design with ADO.NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new LINQ feature, and how to use it within VB and .NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embedding XML within application source code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption and authentication in .NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interacting with data stored in files and directories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web development using ASP.NET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploying an application to a user's workstation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Visual Basic 2008&lt;/em&gt; is ideal for VB 6 programmers who are ready to move to .NET, as well as VB.NET programmers who wish to improve their project-focused software development skills. Programming novices and developers coming from other languages will find the book valuable because of its language instruction and project design knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Once you finish the book, you will have a firm grasp of VB 2008's core concepts and language elements, and understand how to build VB projects as they were intended -- as complete, cohesive solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Written in a lively and engaging style by a developer who's grown up with Visual Basic, this hands-on guide addresses the core topics of the new VB, from basic to complex, with plenty of code examples.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success on the web is measured by usage and growth. Web-based companies live or die by the ability to scale their infrastructure to accommodate increasing demand. This book is a hands-on and practical guide to planning for such growth, with many techniques and considerations to help you plan, deploy, and manage web application infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Art of Capacity Planning&lt;/em&gt; is written by the manager of data operations for the world-famous photo-sharing site Flickr.com, now owned by Yahoo! John Allspaw combines personal anecdotes from many phases of Flickr's growth with insights from his colleagues in many other industries to give you solid guidelines for measuring your growth, predicting trends, and making cost-effective preparations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Topics include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluating tools for measurement and deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity analysis and prediction for storage, database, and application servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing architectures to easily add and measure capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling sudden spikes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicting exponential and explosive growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How cloud services such as EC2 can fit into a capacity strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, Allspaw draws on years of valuable experience, starting from the days when Flickr was relatively small and had to deal with the typical growth pains and cost/performance trade-offs of a typical company with a Web presence. The advice he offers in &lt;em&gt;The Art of Capacity Planning&lt;/em&gt; will not only help you prepare for explosive growth, it will save you tons of grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most books written about Rails cater to programmers looking for information on data structures, &lt;i&gt;Learning Rails&lt;/i&gt; targets web developers whose programming experience is tied directly to the Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Rather than begin with the inner layers of a Rails web application--the models and controllers--this unique book approaches Rails development from the outer layer: the application interface. You'll learn how to create something visible with Rails before reaching the more difficult database models and controller code. With &lt;i&gt;Learning Rails&lt;/i&gt;, you can start from the foundations of web design you already know, and then move more deeply into Ruby, objects, and database structures. This book will help you:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Present web content by building an application with a basic view and a simple controller, while learning Ruby along the way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build forms and process their results, progressing from the simple to the more complex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect forms to models by setting up a database, and use Rails' ActiveRecord to create code that maps to database structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Rails scaffolding to build applications from a view-centric perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add common web application elements such as sessions, cookies, and authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build applications that combine data from multiple tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create simple but dynamic interfaces with Rails and Ajax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Once you complete &lt;i&gt;Learning Rails&lt;/i&gt;, you'll be comfortable working with the Rails web framework, and you'll be well on your way to becoming a Rails guru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have an idea for a Facebook application? With &lt;em&gt;FBML Essentials&lt;/em&gt;, you'll learn how to build it quickly using the Facebook Markup Language (FBML) and other easy-to-use tools in the site's framework. If you can develop a website with HTML, writing a Facebook application with the help of this book will be a breeze. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Of course, Facebook is not just another website. Any applications you write for it will have a potential audience of 16 million dedicated users. It's not just another social networking site, either. Under the surface, Facebook is pretty sophisticated, with a development toolkit that includes it's own modified version of HTML -- FBML -- to customize the look and feel of your Facebook applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With &lt;em&gt;FBML Essentials&lt;/em&gt;, you not only learn how to get started with this toolkit, you also get a complete reference on every FBML tag Facebook has ever written, with examples of how each tag works and advice on the best ways to use these tags in your code. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A walkthrough of a sample Facebook application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design rules for using images, CSS, JavaScript, and forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific chapters on tags -- authorization tags, logic tags, user/group tags, profile-specific tags, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messaging and alerts using FBML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating forms with FBML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifications and requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamic FBML attributes, including MockAJAX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to test your FBML code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A chapter on FBJS, Facebook's version of JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to try your hand at writing a Facebook application, you have a willing audience, an easy-to-use toolkit, and the perfect guide to get you started. &lt;em&gt;FBML Essentials&lt;/em&gt; will help you take your idea from conception to working application in no time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESTful .NET&lt;/em&gt; is the first book that teaches Windows developers to build RESTful web services using the latest Microsoft tools. Written by Windows Communication Foundation (WFC) expert Jon Flanders, this hands-on tutorial demonstrates how you can use WCF and other components of the .NET 3.5 Framework to build, deploy and use REST-based web services in a variety of application scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
RESTful architecture offers a simpler approach to building web services than SOAP, SOA, and the cumbersome WS-&lt;em&gt; stack. And WCF has proven to be a flexible technology for building distributed systems not necessarily tied to WS-&lt;/em&gt; standards. &lt;em&gt;RESTful .NET&lt;/em&gt; provides you with a complete guide to the WCF REST programming model for building web services consumed either by machines or humans. You'll learn how to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Program Read-Only (GET) services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program READ/WRITE services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host REST services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program REST feeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Program AJAX REST clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure REST endpoints&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use workflow to deliver REST services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consume RESTful XML services using WCF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with HTTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with ADO.NET Data Services (Astoria)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RESTful .NET&lt;/em&gt; introduces you to the ideas of REST and RESTful architecture, and includes a detailed discussion of how the Web/REST model plugs into the WCF architecture. If you develop with .NET, it's time to jump on the RESTful bandwagon. This book explains how.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"While REST is simple, WCF is not. To really understand and exploit this part of WCF requires a knowledgeable and experienced guide. I don't know anybody who's better suited for this role than Jon Flanders. ...Jon is first-rate at explaining complicated things. This book is the best introduction I've seen to creating and using these services with WCF."
--David Chappell, Chappell &amp;amp; Associates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is for busy programmers who want a succinct and yet readable guide to C# 3.0 and LINQ. &lt;em&gt;C# 3.0 Pocket Reference&lt;/em&gt; tells you exactly what you need to know, without long introductions or bloated samples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Despite its conciseness, this book doesn't skimp on depth or detail, and embraces the conceptual challenges in learning C# 3.0 and LINQ. Tightly focused and highly practical, this pocket reference covers more ground than many of the big books on C#.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;C# 3.0 Pocket Reference&lt;/em&gt; includes plenty of illustrations and code examples to explain:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Features new to C# 3.0, such as lambda expressions, anonymous types, automatic properties, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All aspects of C# syntax, predefined types, expressions, and operators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating classes, structs, delegates and events, enums, generics and constraints, exception handling, and iterators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The subtleties of boxing, operating overloading, delegate covariance, extension method resolution, interface reimplementation, nullable types, and operating lifting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LINQ, starting with the principles of sequences, deferred execution and standard query operators, and finishing with a complete reference to query syntax-including multiple generators, joining, grouping, and query continuations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consuming, writing, and reflecting on custom attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You'll also find chapters on unsafe code and pointers, preprocessor directives, XML documentation, and a framework overview. If you're already familiar with Java, C++, or an earlier version of C#, &lt;em&gt;C# 3.0 Pocket Reference&lt;/em&gt; is an ideal choice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
No other book or online resource can get you up to speed so quickly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

This reference explains:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;LINQ's key concepts, such as deferred execution, iterator chaining, and type inference in lambda expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The differences between local and interpreted queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C# 3.0's query syntax in detail-including multiple generators, joining, grouping, query continuations, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Query syntax versus lambda syntax, and mixed syntax queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Composition and projection strategies for complex queries&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just three years, Instructables.com has become one of the hottest destinations for makers and DIY enthusiasts of all stripes. Known as "the world's biggest show &amp;amp; tell," makers from around the globe post how-to articles on a staggering variety of topics -- from collecting rainwater for lawn care to hacking toy robots to extracting squid ink. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Now, with more than 10,000 articles, the Instructables staff and editors of &lt;em&gt;MAKE: magazine&lt;/em&gt; -- with help from the Instructables community -- have put together a collection of solid, time- and user-tested technology and craft projects from the site. &lt;em&gt;The Best of Instructables Volume 1&lt;/em&gt; includes plenty of clear, full-color photographs, complete step-by-step instructions, as well as tips, tricks, and new build techniques you won't find anywhere else -- even material never seen before on Instructables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Some of the more popular how-to articles include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The LED Throwie -- magnetized electronic graffiti that's become a phenomenon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to craft beautiful Japanese bento box lunches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovative gaming hacks, such as how to add LED lights and custom-molded buttons to a video game controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New twists on personal items, such as the Keyboard Wallet, the Electric Umbrella, and stuffed animal headphones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
While the book focuses on technology, it also includes such projects as creating cool furniture from cheap components, ways of making your own toys, and killer sci-fi and fantasy costumes and props. Anything but a reference book, &lt;em&gt;The Best of Instructables Volume I&lt;/em&gt; embodies the inspirational fun, creativity, and sense of community that has attracted more than 200,000 registered members in just three years. Many of the articles include sidebars that show how other builders have realized or improved upon the same project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Making things is cool again: everyone wants to be a creator, not just a consumer. This is the spirit of the "new handy heyday", fostered by Instructables.com, &lt;em&gt;MAKE: magazine&lt;/em&gt;, and others, and celebrated by this incredible book -- &lt;em&gt;The Best of Instructables Volume 1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning Perl&lt;/em&gt;, popularly known as "the Llama," is the book most programmers rely on to get started with Perl. The bestselling Perl tutorial since it was first published in 1993, this new fifth edition covers recent changes to the language up to Perl 5.10. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book reflects the combined experience of its authors, who have taught Perl at Stonehenge Consulting since 1991. Years of classroom testing and experience helped shape the book's pace and scope, and this edition is packed with exercises that let you practice the concepts while you follow the text. Topics include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perl data &amp;amp; variable types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subroutines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regular expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;String manipulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists &amp;amp; sorting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smart matching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using third party modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perl is the language for people who want to get work done. Originally targeted to sysadmins for heavy-duty text processing, Perl is now a full-featured programming language suitable for almost any task on almost any platform-from short fixes on the command line to web applications, bioinformatics, finance, and much more. Other books may teach you to program in Perl, but this book will turn you into a Perl programmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you are a project manager looking for a technology-based, easily implemented, and usable solution for project communications, document management, and general project organization, this book is for you!"
-Susan Weese, PgMP, President and Founder, Rhyming Planet&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Most companies don't understand SharePoint's power, and use it simply to share documents or spreadsheets. This hands-on book demonstrates how SharePoint can also help you organize and manage complex projects. With &lt;em&gt;SharePoint for Project Management&lt;/em&gt;, you'll not only understand how to apply common and practical project management concepts in SharePoint, you'll learn how to build a Project Management Information System (PMIS), customized to your project, that can efficiently coordinate communication and collaboration among team members. With this book, you will:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn to apply key project management techniques by leveraging SharePoint as a PMIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track a case study that illustrates the circumstances and processes of an effective SharePoint PMIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appropriately define access permissions for project stakeholders and team members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Centralize project documents and keep track of document history with version control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automate project reporting mechanisms and generate on-demand status reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track project schedules, control changes, and manage project risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate project management tools such as Excel, Microsoft Project, PowerPoint, and Outlook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Each chapter includes activities that let you practice what you learn. Most SharePoint books are either too introductory (for end users), or too technical (for system administrators). &lt;em&gt;SharePoint for Project Management&lt;/em&gt; is just what project managers like you need to learn how to harness the organizational abilities of this powerful software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft SharePoint is perfect for project management, but most companies don't understand it's power. This hands-on book demonstrates how SharePoint can help you organize and manage complex projects -- a decidedly more productive way to use this popular collaboration software. You'll learn how to apply common and practical project management concepts in SharePoint, and build a Project Management Information System (PMIS) that can efficiently coordinate communication and collaboration among team members.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practical book provides a step-by-step approach to testing mission-critical applications for scalability and performance &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they're deployed -- a vital topic to which other books devote one chapter, if that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Businesses today live and die by network applications and web services. Because of the increasing complexity of these programs, and the pressure to deploy them quickly, many professionals don't take the time to ensure that they'll perform well and scale effectively. &lt;em&gt;The Art of Application Performance Testing&lt;/em&gt; explains the complete life cycle of the testing process, and demonstrates best practices to help you plan, gain approval for, coordinate, and conduct performance tests on your applications. With this book, you'll learn to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set realistic performance testing goals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement an effective application performance testing strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interpret performance test results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cope with different application technologies and architectures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use automated performance testing tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test traditional local applications, web-based applications, and web services (SOAs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize and resolves issues that are often overlooked in performance tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Written by a consultant with 30 years of experience in the IT industry and over 12 years experience with performance testing, this easy-to-read book is illustrated with real-world examples and packed with practical advice. &lt;em&gt;The Art of Application Performance Testing&lt;/em&gt; thoroughly explains the pitfalls of an inadequate testing strategy and offers you a robust, structured approach for ensuring that your applications perform well and scale effectively when the need arises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

He organized a group of top-notch photographers for a trek to Tasmania, the exotic island south of mainland Australia, where the only studio was Lightroom on a laptop. In &lt;em&gt;Photoshop Lightroom 2 Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, Aaland uses hands-on knowledge from the trip to demonstrate how Lightroom can help you create the best possible image under any conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This unique tutorial walks you step-by-step through Lightroom's:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Library module for uploading, sorting, tagging, ranking and adding keywords to your images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop module with Adobe Camera RAW for complete non-destructive color and tonal adjustments&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Print module, which includes several templates for printing contact sheets or full images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web module, where you can create Flash or HTML web galleries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With many gorgeous examples shot in the exotic wilds of Tasmania, this book lets you see the results for yourself.

&lt;li&gt;Locate users whose passwords are about to expire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply a security filter to group policy objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for potential replication problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict hosts from performing LDAP queries&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Each recipe includes a discussion explaining how and why the solution works, so you can adapt the problem-solving techniques to similar situations. &lt;em&gt;Active Directory Cookbook&lt;/em&gt; is ideal for any IT professional using Windows Server 2008, Exchange 2007, and Identity Lifecycle Manager 2007, including Active Directory administrators looking to automate task-based solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;"It is rare for me to visit a customer site and not see a copy of Active Directory Cookbook on a shelf somewhere, which is a testament to its usefulness. The Cookbook takes the pain out of everyday AD tasks by providing concise, clear and relevant recipes.  The fact that the recipes are provided using different methods (graphical user interface, command line and scripting) means that the book is suitable for anyone working with AD on a day-to-day basis. The introduction of PowerShell examples in this latest edition will be of particular interest for those looking to transition from VBScript. Laura has also done a great job in extending the Cookbook in this edition to encompass the broad range of changes to AD in Windows Server 2008."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Tony Murray,  Founder of Activedir.org and Directory Services MVP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;"If you already understand Active Directory fundamentals and are looking for
a quick solution to common Active Directory related tasks, look no further,
you have found the book that you need."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--joe Richards, Directory Services MVP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;"The Active Directory Cookbook is the real deal... a soup-to-nuts catalog of every administrative task an Active Directory administrator needs to perform. If you administer an Active Directory installation, this is the very first book you have to put on your shelf." &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Gil Kirkpatrick, Chief Architect, Active Directory and Identity Management, Quest Software and Directory Services MVP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;When you need practical hands-on support for Active Directory, the updated edition of this Cookbook provides quick solutions to more than 300 problems you might encounter when deploying, administering, and automating Microsoft's network directory service. You'll find recipes for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), ADAM, multi-master replication, Domain Name System (DNS), Group Policy, the Active Directory Schema, and many other features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With this book, you will:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn about WCF architecture and essential building blocks, including key concepts such as reliability and transport session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use built-in features such as service hosting, instance management, concurrency management, transactions, disconnected queued calls, and security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take advantage of relevant design options, tips, and best practices in Lowy's ServiceModelEx framework to increase your productivity and the quality of your WCF services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the rationale behind particular design decisions, and discover poorly documented and little-understood aspects of SOA development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photoshop Elements 7 includes lots of new tools for sprucing up your photos, like the Scene Cleaner that lets you get rid of unwanted elements and the Smart Brush that makes touch-ups a breeze. But the one thing you won't find in Elements is reader-friendly guidance on how to get the most out of this powerful program. Enter &lt;em&gt;Photoshop Elements 7: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt;, ready to explain not only &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the tools and commands work, but &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; to use them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With this bestselling book (now in its 5th edition), you'll learn everything from the basics of loading photos into Elements to the new online photo-sharing and storage service that Adobe's offering (for free!) at Photoshop.com. There's so much to Elements 7 that knowing what to do -- and when to do it -- is tricky. That's why this book carefully explains all the tools and options by putting each one into a clear, easy-to-understand context.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn to import, organize, and fix photos&lt;/b&gt; quickly and easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repair and restore old and damaged photos&lt;/b&gt;, and retouch any image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jazz up your pictures&lt;/b&gt; with dozens of filters, frames, and special effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn which tools the pros use&lt;/b&gt; -- you'll finally understand how layers work!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create collages and photo layout pages&lt;/b&gt; for scrapbooks and other projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fix your photos online&lt;/b&gt; and synch the changes to your own photo library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As always, author Barbara Brundage lets you know which features work well, which don't, and why -- all with a bit of wit and good humor. Dive into Adobe's outstanding photo editor and find out why this Missing Manual is the bestselling book on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have what it takes to become a game developer? With this hands-on book, you'll learn quickly and easily how to develop computer games with Microsoft's XNA 3.0 framework-not just for your PC, but for Xbox 360 and the Microsoft Zune as well. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Written by an experienced university-level game development instructor, &lt;em&gt;Learning XNA 3.0&lt;/em&gt; walks you through the framework in a clear and understandable step-by-step format. Each chapter offers a self-contained lesson with lots of illustrations and annotated examples to help you master key concepts. Once you finish the book, you'll know how to develop sophisticated games from start to finish.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn game development concepts from 2D animation to 3D cameras and effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delve into high-level shader language (HLSL) and introductory artificial intelligence concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop three complete and exciting games using 2D,3D and multiplayer concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and deploy games to the Xbox 360 and the Microsoft Zune&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
While teaching XNA to beginning game developers, author Aaron Reed noticed that several key concepts were difficult for students to grasp. &lt;em&gt;Learning XNA 3.0&lt;/em&gt; was written specifically to address those issues. With this book, you can test your understanding and practice new skills as you go with unique "Test Your Knowledge" exercises and review questions in each chapter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Why wait? Amaze your family and friends by building your own games for the PC, Xbox 360, and Zune-with &lt;em&gt;Learning XNA 3.0&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Become familiar with Hadoop's data and I/O building blocks for compression, data integrity, serialization, and persistence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover common pitfalls and advanced features for writing real-world MapReduce programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design, build, and administer a dedicated Hadoop cluster, or run Hadoop in the cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Pig, a high-level query language for large-scale data processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take advantage of HBase, Hadoop's database for structured and semi-structured data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn ZooKeeper, a toolkit of coordination primitives for building distributed systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have lots of data -- whether it's gigabytes or petabytes -- Hadoop is the perfect solution. &lt;em&gt;Hadoop: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; is the most thorough book available on the subject.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Now you have the opportunity to learn about Hadoop from a master-not only of the technology, but also of common sense and plain talk."
-- Doug Cutting, Hadoop Founder, Yahoo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter where you are on the organizational ladder, the odds are high that you've delivered a high-stakes presentation to your peers, your boss, your customers, or the general public. Presentation software is one of the few tools that requires professionals to think visually on an almost daily basis. But unlike verbal skills, effective visual expression is not easy, natural, or actively taught in schools or business training programs. &lt;em&gt;slide:ology&lt;/em&gt; fills that void.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Written by Nancy Duarte, President and CEO of Duarte Design, the firm that created the presentation for Al Gore's Oscar-winning film, &lt;em&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/em&gt;, this book is full of practical approaches to visual story development that can be applied by anyone. The book combines conceptual thinking and inspirational design, with insightful case studies from the world's leading brands. With &lt;em&gt;slide:ology&lt;/em&gt; you'll learn to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connect with specific audiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn ideas into informative graphics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use sketching and diagramming techniques effectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create graphics that enable audiences to process information easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop truly influential presentations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize presentation technology to your advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of presentations and billions of slides have been produced -- and most of them miss the mark. &lt;em&gt;slide:ology&lt;/em&gt; will challenge your traditional approach to creating slides by teaching you how to be a visual thinker. And it will help your career by creating momentum for your cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding SQL's underlying theory is the best way to guarantee that your SQL code is correct and your database schema is robust and maintainable. On the other hand, if you're not well versed in the theory, you can fall into several traps. In &lt;em&gt;SQL and Relational Theory&lt;/em&gt;, author C.J. Date demonstrates how you can apply relational theory directly to your use of SQL. With numerous examples and clear explanations of the reasoning behind them, you'll learn how to deal with common SQL dilemmas, such as:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Should database access granted be through views instead of base tables?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nulls in your database are causing you to get wrong answers. Why? What can you do about it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could you write an SQL query to find employees who have never been in the same department for more than six months at a time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL supports "quantified comparisons," but they're better avoided. Why? How do you avoid them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constraints are crucially important, but most SQL products don't support them properly. What can you do to resolve this situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Database theory and practice have evolved since Edgar Codd originally defined the relational model back in 1969. Independent of any SQL products, &lt;em&gt;SQL and Relational Theory&lt;/em&gt; draws on decades of research to present the most up-to-date treatment of the material available anywhere. Anyone with a modest to advanced background in SQL will benefit from the many insights in this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding SQL's underlying theory is the best way to guarantee that your SQL code is correct and your database schema is robust and maintainable. In &lt;em&gt;SQL and Relational Theory&lt;/em&gt;, author C.J. Date demonstrates how you can apply relational theory directly to your use of SQL, with numerous examples and clear explanations of the reasoning behind them. Anyone with a modest to advanced background in SQL will benefit from the many insights in this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;   "We are in the Stone Age of digital photography. We've figured out how to make some tools, but it is just now beginning to dawn on us what we might do with them. I've often been frustrated at the concentration on the technical aspect of digital photography with so little discussion of the aesthetics and heart behind the image making. This book is essentially a distillation of what I've been teaching over the last 25 years."   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Master photographer Stephen Johnson has been taking beautiful landscape photography for decades, and teaching others the practical art of image making since 1977. While he started out with traditional film camera techniques, Johnson is widely recognized among his peers as a pioneer of digital photography. &lt;i&gt;Stephen Johnson on Digital Photography&lt;/i&gt; chronicles his ride on the bleeding edge of this medium's evolution, and provides a practical in-depth introduction to digital photography that offers the latest techniques for beginning and experienced photographers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What sets this guide apart from other books on the topic is its approach and execution: This isn't a Photoshop book, although Photoshop has its place within the book; it's a book that a master teacher and photographer creates after a lifetime of showing others how to understand and make great photography. With 5 color photographs throughout, including black/gray duotones, and 715 illustrations reproduced with a 200 line screen, Johnson's book covers everything from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basics of digital photography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Film camera techniques vs. digital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practical approaches of the filmless photographer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Techniques of the digital darkroom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A photographer  &amp;#8482;s digital journey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photography, art and the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a holistic work (and method for teaching) that embraces the state of photographic tools and techniques, blended with suggestions and experiences on why I make photographs, Johnson says. At its best, photography rides that crest where technology and art intersect. But the deepest engagement that photography can bring remains its ability to capture and hold a moment before the lens. In this age of digital manipulation, that fundamental fact must be remembered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

His new book chronicles his ride on the bleeding edge of this medium's evolution, and provides a practical in-depth introduction to digital photography that includes the latest techniques.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn how to deliver richer, more interactive web experiences to your users using ASP.NET Atlas, Microsoft's new framework for building Ajax-savvy web sites. Web developers of all persuasions have embraced the Ajax suite of technologies (JavaScript, HTTP, XML and more) as a way to implement pages that are faster, livelier and more desktop-like in their behavior. Now Atlas brings the power of Ajax to ASP.NET 2.0 developers with controls, script libraries and server support that delivers engaging results without the pain that writing complex JavaScript can entail. Better yet, Atlas web pages are standards based and even run cross-browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Atlas&lt;/i&gt; is not just another "drag and drop" ASP.NET 2.0 book, but dives into the technologies that make it work. You'll begin with a tour of the technologies most often associated with Ajax, from JavaScript and XMLHttpRequest to JSON and the DOM. With the fundamentals in place, author JavaScript expert Christian Wenz unpacks the Atlas framework and shows you how to put its tools to work. You'll learn to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the architecture of Atlas and the role played by server
conrols, such as ScriptManager and UpdatePanel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use core Atlas controls and extenders to build more interactive pages with text fields that autocomplete, user input that is validated, controls that can be dragged and dropped, and much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bind, display, and update data without causing the entire page to refresh and use the Atlas web services bridge to consume third-party services beyond the domain of your application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate Microsoft Virtual Earth into an application, use Atlas with Web Parts, and create a Windows Live Gadget &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Atlas with PHP and explore other non-Microsoft Ajax tools for ASP.NET&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Atlas&lt;/i&gt; is not just another "drag and drop" ASP.NET book, but one that teaches you the fundamental Ajax technologies that make Atlas work. You'll begin with a tour of JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest, JSON and the DOM. With the fundamentals in place, author Christian Wenz unpacks the Atlas framework and shows you how to put its tools to work building more interactive web sites. Also available is a free guide that shows readers of this book how to migrate its content and examples to ASP.NET AJAX Version 1.0, the successor to Atlas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft releases Windows Vista, the new operating system will support applications that employ graphics now used by computer games--clear, stunning, and active. The cornerstone for building these new user interfaces is XAML ("Zammel"), the XML-based markup language that works with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Vista's new graphics subsystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

An acronym for Extensible Application Markup Language, XAML offers a wealth of new controls and elements with exciting capabilities, including animation and rendering of 3D graphics. Windows developers are already jazzed by the possibilities of using XAML for fixed and flow format documents like PDF and HTML, 2D and 3D vector-based graphics, form development, animation, audio and video, transparent layering, and a lot more. Many feel that XAML will eliminate the need for multiple file formats or plug-ins (read: Flash), while lowering development costs and reducing time to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

The problem is, most developers don't know XAML. While it is fairly easy to understand, you still need a quick guide to bring you up to speed before Vista's release, and that's where this book's simple, no nonsense approach comes in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;XAML in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; covers everything necessary to design user interfaces and .NET applications that take advantage of WPF. Prerequisites such as Microsoft's new unified build system, MSBuild, and core XAML constructs and syntax--including shortcuts--are all presented with plenty of examples to get you started. The Core XAML Reference section lets you dig even deeper into syntax rules and attributes for all XAML elements with a series of quick-reference chapters. This section divides XAML elements into logical categories of elements, controls, shapes and geometry, layout, animations, and transformations for easy reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;XAML in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; helps you learn, firsthand, how to use this XML-based markup language to implement the new generation of user interface graphics. As one reviewer noted, "Strong code examples and an efficient, conversational style take the tedium out of learning XAML and make the subject understandable--even interesting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than a million dedicated programmers, Perl has proven to be the best computing language for the latest trends in computing and business. While other  languages have stagnated, Perl remains fresh, thanks to its community-based development model, which encourages the sharing of information among users. This tradition of knowledge-sharing allows developers to find answers to almost any Perl question they can dream up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you can find many of those answers right here in &lt;i&gt;Perl Hacks&lt;/i&gt;. Like all books in O'Reilly's Hacks Series, &lt;i&gt;Perl Hacks&lt;/i&gt; appeals to a variety of programmers, whether you're an experienced developer or a dabbler who simply enjoys exploring technology. Each hack is a short lesson--some are practical exercises that teach you essential skills, while others merely illustrate some of the fun things that Perl can do. Most hacks have two parts: a direct answer to the immediate problem you need to solve right now and a deeper, subtler technique that you can adapt to other situations. Learn how to add CPAN shortcuts to the Firefox web browser, read files backwards, write graphical games in Perl, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;For your convenience, &lt;i&gt;Perl Hacks&lt;/i&gt; is divided by topic--not according to
any sense of relative difficulty--so you can skip around and stop at any hack you like. Chapters include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Productivity Hacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Munging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with Modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object Hacks&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>MAKE Magazine: The First Year</title>
    <author>Mark Frauenfelder Edited</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From out of nowhere, MAKE has rapidly become one of the hottest new magazines to hit the newsstands. Often coined "the bible of the Tech DIY movement" MAKE has coalesced a passionate if rather unorthodox following of geeks, gearheads, tech enthusiasts, hackers, tinkerers and artists united by a common compulsion to reconfigure the technology in their lives; even when it means violating a manufacturer's warranty or two.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Through the brilliantly written and beautifully illustrated magazine, podcasts and makezine.com website, the MAKE team has already won broad acclaim for their clear yet down-to-earth coverage and uncanny instinct for what moves Makers, and their ability to nail the curiosity, vibrance, and passion of the rapidly emerging "tech DIY" movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this special re-release, all 4-Volumes of MAKE's first year are combined in a special 4-Volume Collector's Set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to mastering any Unix system, especially Linux and Mac OS X, is a thorough knowledge of shell scripting. Scripting is a way to harness and customize the power of any Unix system, and it's an essential skill for any Unix users, including system administrators and professional OS X developers. But beneath this simple promise lies a treacherous ocean of variations in Unix commands and standards.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;bash Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; teaches shell scripting the way Unix masters practice the craft. It presents a variety of recipes and tricks for all levels of shell programmers so that anyone can become a proficient user of the most common Unix shell -- the bash shell -- and cygwin or other popular Unix emulation packages. Packed full of useful scripts, along with examples that explain how to create better scripts, this new cookbook gives professionals and power users everything they need to automate routine tasks and enable them to truly manage their systems -- rather than have their systems manage them.

      <subject>History</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;p&gt;"Self-forgetfulness is the reigning temptation of the technological era. This is why we so readily give our assent to the absurd proposition that a computer can add two plus two, despite the obvious fact that it can do nothing of the sort--not if we have in mind anything remotely resembling what we do when we add numbers. In the computer's case, the mechanics of addition involve no motivation, no consciousness of the task, no mobilization of the will, no metabolic activity, no imagination. And its performance brings neither the satisfaction of accomplishment nor the strengthening of practical skills and cognitive capacities."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In this insightful book, author Steve Talbott, software programmer and technical writer turned researcher and editor for The Nature Institute, challenges us to step back and take an objective look at the technology driving our lives. At a time when 65 percent of American consumers spend more time with their PCs than they do with their significant others, according to a recent study, Talbott illustrates that we're forgetting one important thing--our Selves, the human spirit from which technology stems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Whether we're surrendering intimate details to yet another database, eschewing our physical communities for online social networks, or calculating our net worth, we freely give our power over to technology until, he says, "we arrive at a computer's-eye view of the entire world of industry, commerce, and society at large...an ever more closely woven web of programmed logic."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Digital technology certainly makes us more efficient. But when efficiency is the only goal, we have no way to know whether we're going in the right or wrong direction. Businesses replace guiding vision with a spreadsheet's bottom line. Schoolteachers are replaced by the computer's dataflow. Indigenous peoples give up traditional skills for the dazzle and ease of new gadgets. Even the Pentagon's zeal to replace "boots on the ground" with technology has led to the mess in Iraq. And on it goes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The ultimate danger is that, in our willingness to adapt ourselves to technology, "we will descend to the level of the computational devices we have engineered--not merely imagining ever new and more sophisticated automatons, but reducing ourselves to automatons."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
To transform our situation, we need to see it in a new and unaccustomed light, and that's what Talbott provides by examining the deceiving virtues of technology--how we're killing education, socializing our machines, and mechanizing our society.
Once you take this eye-opening journey, you will think more clearly about how you consume technology and how you allow it to consume you.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Nothing is as rare or sorely needed in our tech-enchanted culture right now as intelligent criticism of technology, and Steve Talbott is exactly the critic we've been waiting for: trenchant, sophisticated, and completely original. Devices of the Soul is an urgent and important book."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Michael Pollan, author of &lt;i&gt;The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Botany of Desire: A Plant's Eye View of the World&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Steve Talbott is a rare voice of clarity, humanity, and passion in a world enthralled by machines and calculation. His new book, Devices of the Soul, lays out a frightening and at the same time inspiring analysis of what computers and computer-like thinking are doing to us, our children, and the future of our planet. Talbott is no Luddite. He fully understands and appreciates the stunning power of technology for both good and evil. His cool and precise skewering of the fuzzy thinking and mindless enthusiasm of the technology true believers is tempered by his modesty, the elegance of his writing, and his abiding love for the world of nature and our capacity for communion with it. "
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Edward Miller, Former editor, Harvard Education Letter
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Those who care about the healthy and wholesome lives of children can gain much from Steve Talbott's wisdom. He examines the need to help children spend more time touching nature and real life and less touching keyboards. He eloquently questions the assumption that speeding up learning is a good thing. Is, after all, a sped-up life a well-lived life? Most importantly, he reminds all of us that technology is just one part of life and ought not to overshadow the life of self and soul."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Joan Almon, Coordinator, Alliance for Childhood
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"One of the most original and provocative writers of our time, Steve Talbott offers a rich assortment of insightful reflections on the nature of our humanity, challenging our own thinking and conventional wisdom about advances in technology."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Dorothy E. Denning, Department of Defense Analysis, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Are you experiencing growing unease as computational metaphors have seized our discourse? Steve Talbott offers immediate relief. You are not losing your mind! Chapter after chapter, he shows how to draw on the powers of technology without losing your soul or breaking your heart."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Peter Denning, Past President of ACM, Monterey, California
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Steve Talbott is a rare writer whose words can alter one's entire perception of the world. He is our most original and perceptive defender of the wholeness of life against the onslaught of mechanism. Devices of the Soul is written with Talbott's typical grace and clarity. It displays a quality hardly found anymore in our high tech culture--wisdom. "
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Lowell Monke, Associate Professor of Education, Wittenberg University&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Devices of the Soul&lt;/i&gt;,  Steve Talbott challenges readers to critically examine society's ever-increasing detachment from its physical surroundings and reflect on its growing dependence on techno-wizardry. Why? In an era when 65 percent of American consumers spend more time with their PCs than with their loved ones, according to a recent study, Talbott insists something vital is slipping away--our Selves, the human spirit from which technology stems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Self-forgetfulness is the reigning temptation of the technological era. This is why we so readily give our assent to the absurd proposition that a computer can add two plus two, despite the obvious fact that it can do nothing of the sort-not if we have in mind anything remotely resembling what we do when we add numbers," writes Talbott.

&lt;/ul&gt;
Completing the list for a particular observing club entitles anyone who is a member of the Astronomical League or RASC to an award, which includes a certificate and, in some cases, a lapel pin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book is perfect for amateur astronomers, students, teachers, or anyone who is ready to dive into this rewarding hobby. Who knows? You might even find a new object, like amateur astronomer Jay McNeil. On a clear cold night in January 2004, he spotted a previously undiscovered celestial object near Orion, now called McNeil's Nebula. Discover what awaits you in the night sky with the &lt;em&gt;Illustrated Guide to Astronomical Wonders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This popular Build-It-Yourself (BIY) PC book covers everything you want to know about building your own system: Planning and picking out the right components, step-by-step instructions for assembling your perfect PC, and an insightful discussion of why you'd want to do it in the first place. Most big brand computers from HP, Dell and others use lower-quality components so they can meet their aggressive pricing targets. But component manufacturers also make high-quality parts that you can either purchase directly, or obtain through distributors and resellers. Consumers and corporations alike are opting to build rather than buy PCs to ensure high quality and compatibility.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The new edition of Building the Perfect PC shows you how to construct a variety of top-flight systems with the latest technology, including AMD Socket AM-2 and Intel Core 2 processors, that are Vista- and Linux-ready. The book includes several new options, including:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; A Budget PC you can build for approximately $350 that offers performance and reliability similar to that of mainstream systems
 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; A full-blown media-center system that runs Linux and MythTV or Windows MCE with multiple tuners and HDTV support
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fire-breathing high-performance gaming system
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fast, low-power, low-heat, low-noise, Small Form Factor system (the size of a shoe box)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A low-cost SOHO (small office, home office) server system with a 2 terabyte (2,000 GB) disk subsystem that's suitable for a residential environment rather than a server closet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your technical experience, &lt;em&gt;Building the Perfect PC&lt;/em&gt; will guide you through the entire process of building or upgrading your own computer. You'll use the latest top-quality components, including Intel's Core 2 Duo and AMD's Athlon X2 CPUs. And you'll know exactly what's under the hood and how to fix or upgrade your PC, should that become necessary. Not only is the process fun, but the result is often less expensive and always better quality and far more satisfying than anything you could buy off the shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>CSS: The Missing Manual</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web site design has grown up. Unlike the old days, when designers cobbled together
    chunky HTML, bandwidth-hogging graphics, and a prayer to make their sites look good,
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) now lets your inner designer come out and play. But CSS
    isn't just a tool to pretty up your site; it's a reliable method for handling all
    kinds of presentation--from fonts and colors to page layout. &lt;i&gt;CSS: The Missing
    Manual&lt;/i&gt; clearly explains this powerful design language and how you can use it to
    build sparklingly new Web sites or refurbish old sites that are ready for an upgrade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like their counterparts in print page-layout programs, style sheets allow
    designers to apply typographic styles, graphic enhancements, and precise layout
    instructions to elements on a Web page. Unfortunately, due to CSS's complexity and
    the many challenges of building pages that work in all Web browsers, most Web authors
    treat CSS as a kind of window-dressing to spruce up the appearance of their sites.
    Integrating CSS with a site's underlying HTML is hard work, and often frustratingly
    complicated. As a result many of the most powerful features of CSS are left untapped.
    With this book, beginners and Web-building veterans alike can learn how to navigate
    the ins-and-outs of CSS and take complete control over their Web pages'
    appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author David McFarland (the bestselling author of O'Reilly's &lt;i&gt;Dreamweaver: The
    Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;) combines crystal-clear explanations, real-world examples, a dash
    of humor, and dozens of step-by-step tutorials to show you ways to design sites with
    CSS that work consistently across browsers. You'll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create HTML that's simpler, uses less code, is search-engine friendly, and
      works well with CSS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Style text by changing fonts, colors, font sizes, and adding borders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn simple HTML links into complex and attractive navigation bars-complete
      with CSS-only rollover effects that add interactivity to your Web pages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Style images to create effective photo galleries and special effects like
      CSS-based drop shadows&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make HTML forms look great without a lot of messy HTML&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overcome the most hair-pulling browser bugs so your Web pages work consistently
      from browser to browser&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create complex layouts using CSS, including multi-column designs that don't
      require using old techniques like HTML tables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Style Web pages for printing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike competing books, this Missing Manual doesn't assume that everyone in the
    world only surfs the Web with Microsoft's Internet Explorer; our book provides
    support for all major Web browsers and is one of the first books to thoroughly
    document the newly expanded CSS support in IE7, currently in beta release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to learn how to turn humdrum Web sites into destinations that will capture
    viewers and keep them longer? Pick up &lt;i&gt;CSS: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; and learn the
    real magic of this tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQL is the language of databases.  It's used to create and maintain database objects, place data into those objects, query the data, modify the data, and, finally, delete data that is no longer needed.  Databases lie at the heart of many, if not most business applications.  Chances are very good that if you're involved with software development, you're using SQL to some degree.  And if you're using SQL, you should own a good reference or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

Now available in an updated second edition, our very popular &lt;i&gt;SQL Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; is a major help to programmers, database administrators, and everyone who uses SQL in their day-to-day work. The &lt;i&gt;SQL Pocket Guide&lt;/i&gt; is a concise reference to frequently used SQL statements and commonly used SQL functions.  Not just an endless collection of syntax diagrams, this portable guide addresses the language's complexity head on and leads by example. The information in this edition has been updated to reflect the latest versions of the most commonly used SQL variants including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oracle Database 10g, Release 2 (including
the free Oracle Database 10g Express Edition (XE))&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft SQL Server 2005&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MySQL 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IBM DB2 8.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PostreSQL 8.1 database&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there an easier way to build and deliver rich internet applications (RIAs) other than the Flash IDE or Ajax? Absolutely. With Adobe Flex 2, the Flex 2 SDK, and this book, you have all you need to build RIAs. Programming Flex 2 offers you plenty of practical and useful examples that reveal how and why to use a particular feature of Flex 2, and when and when not to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the Adobe Developer Library, Programming Flex 2 is the authoritative guide to this new Adobe framework. You learn to use a markup language called MXML and a vast library of off-the-shelf and highly-configurable components to build Flash-based applications that combine the immediacy of the Web with the functionality and responsiveness of desktop applications. You also discover why -- with the Flash Player runtime environment and the powerful ActionScript 3.0 programming language -- the possibilities with Flex 2 are nearly limitless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing Layout&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with Components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with Media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Transitions and Effects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customizing Application Appearance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client Data Communication and Remote Data Communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging Flex Framework Applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating Custom Components&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flex may be easier to learn than the Flash IDE, but you still need a reliable guide to the framework. Programming Flex 2 not only serves as a reference, but provides valuable and practical insight into this new technology. As you learn how to build Flex applications, you'll also discover how Flex works. This book supplies all the information you need in one convenient place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adobe Developer Library&lt;/b&gt; is a co-publishing partnership between O'Reilly Media and Adobe Systems, Inc. and is designed to produce the number one information resources for developers who use Adobe technologies. Created in 2006, the Adobe Developer Library is the official source for comprehensive learning solutions to help developers create expressive and interactive web applications that can reach virtually anyone on any platform. With top-notch books and innovative online resources covering the latest in rich Internet application development, the Adobe Developer Library offers expert training and in-depth resources, straight from the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Flex 2&lt;/em&gt; discusses the Flex framework in context. The authors introduce features with practical and useful examples that tell the reader not only how, but also the reasons why to use a particular feature, when to use it, and when not to. This book is written for development professionals. While the book does not assume the audience has worked with Flash technologies previously, readers will benefit from the book most if they have previously built web-based, n-tiered applications.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book is part of the official Adobe Developer Library series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ActionScript 3.0 is a huge upgrade to Flash's programming language. The enhancements to ActionScript's performance, feature set, ease of use, cleanliness, and sophistication are considerable. &lt;em&gt;Essential ActionScript 3.0&lt;/em&gt; focuses on the core language and object-oriented programming, along with the Flash Player API.
&lt;em&gt;Essential ActionScript&lt;/em&gt; has become the #1 resource for the Flash and ActionScript development community, and the reason is the author, Colin Moock. Many people even refer to it simply as "The Colin Moock book."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
And for good reason: No one is better at turning ActionScript inside out, learning its nuances and capabilities, and then explaining everything in such an accessible way. Colin Moock is not just a talented programmer and technologist; he's also a gifted teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Essential ActionScript 3.0&lt;/em&gt; is a radically overhauled update to &lt;em&gt;Essential ActionScript 2.0&lt;/em&gt;. True to its roots, the book once again focuses on the core language and object-oriented programming, but also adds a deep look at the centerpiece of Flash Player's new API: display programming. Enjoy hundreds of brand new pages covering exciting new language features, such as the DOM-based event architecture, E4X, and namespaces--all brimming with real-world sample code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The ActionScript 3.0 revolution is here, and &lt;em&gt;Essential ActionScript 3.0&lt;/em&gt;'s steady hand is waiting to guide you through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adobe Developer Library&lt;/b&gt; is a co-publishing partnership between O'Reilly Media and Adobe Systems, Inc. and is designed to produce the number one information resources for developers who use Adobe technologies.

    <description>&lt;p&gt;More than two years in the making, ActionScript 3.0 presents perhaps the most substantial upgrade to Flash's programming language ever. The enhancements to ActionScript's performance, feature set, ease of use, cleanliness, and sophistication are simply staggering. Revolutionary improvements abound. &lt;em&gt;Essential ActionScript 3.0&lt;/em&gt; is an update to &lt;em&gt;Essential ActionScript 2.0&lt;/em&gt;, once again focusing on the core language and object-oriented programming with some coverage of the Flash Player API. Approximately half of the book focuses on the new features and functionality of ActionScript 3.0, while the rest focuses on changes between the 2 and 3 releases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well before Ajax and Microsoft's Windows Presentation Foundation hit the scene, Macromedia offered the first method for building web pages with the responsiveness and functionality of desktop programs with its Flash-based "Rich Internet Applications". Now, new owner Adobe is taking Flash and its powerful capabilities beyond the Web and making it a full-fledged development environment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than focus on theory, the ActionScript 3.0 Cookbook concentrates on the practical application of ActionScript, with more than 300 solutions you can use to solve a wide range of common coding dilemmas. You'll find recipes that show you how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detect the user's Flash Player version or their operating system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build custom classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format dates and currency types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with strings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build user interface components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with audio and video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make remote procedure calls using Flash Remoting and web services&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Load, send, and search XML data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much, much more ...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Each code recipe presents the Problem, Solution, and Discussion of how you can use it in other ways or personalize it for your own needs, and why it works. You can quickly locate the recipe that most closely matches your situation and get the solution without reading the whole book to understand the underlying code. Solutions progress from short recipes for small problems to more complex scripts for thornier riddles, and the discussions offer a deeper analysis for resolving similar issues in the future, along with possible design choices and ramifications. You'll even learn how to link modular ActionScript pieces together to create rock-solid solutions for Flex 2 and Flash applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When you're not sure how ActionScript 3.0 works or how to approach a specific programming dilemma, you can simply pick up the book, flip to the relevant recipe(s), and quickly find the solution you're looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you know whether a hot technology will succeed or fail? Or where the next big idea will come from? The best answers come not from the popular myths we tell about innovation, but instead from time-tested truths that explain how we've made it this far. This book shows the way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In &lt;em&gt;The Myths of Innovation&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Scott Berkun takes a careful look at innovation history, including the software and Internet Age, to reveal how ideas truly become successful innovations-truths that people can apply to today's challenges.
Using dozens of examples from the history of technology, business, and the arts, you'll learn how to convert the knowledge you have into ideas that can change the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why all innovation is a collaborative process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How innovation depends on persuasion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why problems are more important than solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the good innovation is the enemy of the great&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why the biggest challenge is knowing when it's good enough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"For centuries before Google, MIT, and IDEO, modern hotbeds of innovation, we struggled to explain any kind of creation, from the universe itself to the multitudes of ideas around us. While we can make atomic bombs, and dry-clean silk ties, we still don't have satisfying answers for simple questions like: Where do songs come from? Are there an infinite variety of possible kinds of cheese? How did Shakespeare and Stephen King invent so much, while we're satisfied watching sitcom reruns? Our popular answers have been unconvincing, enabling misleading, fantasy-laden myths to grow strong."
-- Scott Berkun, from the text.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Insightful, inspiring, evocative, and just plain fun to read it's totally great."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
-- John Seely Brown, former Chief Scientist of Xerox, and Director, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC); current Chief of Confusion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Small, simple, powerful: an innovative book about innovation."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
-- Don Norman, Nielsen Norman Group, Northwestern University; author of Emotional Design and Design of Everyday Things&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"The naked truth about innovation is ugly, funny, and eye-opening, but it
sure isn't what most of us have come to believe. With this book, Berkun sets us free to try to change the world unencumbered with misconceptions about how innovation happens."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
-- Guy Kawasaki, author of The Art of the Start&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Brimming with insights and historical examples, Berkun's book not only debunks widely held myths about innovation but also points the ways toward making your new ideas stick.  Even in today's ultra-busy commercial world, reading this book will be time well spent."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
-- Tom Kelley, GM, IDEO; author of The Ten Faces of Innovation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"This book cuts through the hype, analyzes what is essential, and more
importantly, what is not. You will leave with a thorough understanding of
what really drives innovation."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
-- Werner Vogels, CTO, Amazon.com&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"I loved this book. It's an easy-to-read playbook for anyone wanting to lead
and manage positive change in their business."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
-- Frank McDermott, Marketing Manager, EMI Music&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Scott Berkun knows innovation. A member of the Internet Explorer team at Microsoft from 1994-1999, he is a full-time author at www.scottberkun.com and wrote the 2005 bestseller, The Art of Project Management (O'Reilly). He also teaches creative thinking at the University of Washington. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>MySQL Cookbook</title>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with MySQL's popularity has come a flood of questions about solving specific problems, and that's where this Cookbook is essential. Designed as a handy resource when you need quick solutions or techniques, the book offers dozens of short, focused pieces of code and hundreds of worked-out examples for programmers of all levels who don't have the time (or expertise) to solve MySQL problems from scratch.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The new edition covers MySQL 5.0 and its powerful new features, as well as the older but still widespread MySQL 4.1. One major emphasis of this book is how to use SQL to formulate queries for particular kinds of questions, using the mysql client program included in MySQL distributions. The other major emphasis is how to write programs that interact with the MySQL server through an API. You'll find plenty of examples using several language APIs in multiple scenarios and situations, including the use of Ruby to retrieve and format data. There are also many new examples for using Perl, PHP, Python, and Java as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other recipes in the book teach you to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access data from multiple tables at the same time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use SQL to select, sort, and summarize rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find matches or mismatches between rows in two tables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine intervals between dates or times, including age calculations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store images into MySQL and retrieve them for display in web pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get LOAD DATA to read your data files properly or find which values in the file are invalid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use strict mode to prevent entry of bad data into your database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy a table or a database to another server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate sequence numbers to use as unique row identifiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create database events that execute according to a schedule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a lot more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;MySQL Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; doesn't attempt to develop full-fledged, complex applications. Instead, it's intended to assist you in developing applications yourself by helping you get past problems that have you stumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A handy resource when you need quick solutions or techniques, this Cookbook addresses specific questions in using MySQL. You'll find dozens of short, focused pieces of code and hundreds of worked-out examples that are perfect for programmers of all levels who don't have the time (or expertise) to solve MySQL problems from scratch.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of anticipation and delay, the W3C finally released the XSLT 2.0 standard in January 2007. The revised edition of this classic book offers practical, real-world examples that demonstrate how you can apply XSLT stylesheets to XML data using either the new specification, or the older XSLT 1.0 standard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
XSLT is a critical language for converting XML documents into other formats, such as HTML code or a PDF file. With &lt;em&gt;XSLT&lt;/em&gt;, you get a thorough understanding of XSLT and XPath and their relationship to other web standards, along with recommendations for a honed toolkit in an open platform-neutral, standards-based environment. This book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covers the XSLT basics, including simple stylesheets and methods for setting up transformation engines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walks you through the many parts of XSLT, particularly XSLT's template-based approach to transformations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applies both XSLT 1.0 and 2.0 solutions to the same problems, helping you decide which version of XSLT is more appropriate for your project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Includes profuse examples that complement both the tutorial and the reference material&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new edition of &lt;em&gt;XSLT&lt;/em&gt; has been updated thoroughly to explain XSLT 2.0's many dependencies, notably XML Schema and XPath 2.0. Want to find out how the 2.0 specification improves on the old? This book will explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never has something cried out for a cookbook quite as much as Cisco's Internetwork Operating System (IOS).  IOS is powerful and flexible, but also confusing and daunting.  Most tasks can be accomplished in several different ways.  And you don't want to spend precious time figuring out which way is best when you're trying to solve a problem quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
That's what this cookbook is for.  Fortunately, most router configuration tasks can be broken down into several more or less independent steps: you configure an interface, you configure a routing protocol, you set up backup links, you implement packet filters and other access control mechanisms.  What you really need is a set of recipes that show you how to perform the most common tasks, so you can quickly come up with a good configuration for your site.  And you need to know that these solutions work: you don't want to find yourself implementing a backup link at 2 A.M. because your main link is down and the backup link you set up when you installed the router wasn't quite right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoroughly revised and expanded, &lt;i&gt;Cisco IOS Cookbook&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition, adds sections on MPLS, Security, IPv6, and IP Mobility, and presents solutions to the most common configuration problems, including:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configuring interfaces of many types, from serial to ATM and Frame Relay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring all of the common IP routing protocols (RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring other services, including DHCP and NTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up backup links, and using HSRP to configure backup routers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing the router, including SNMP and other solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using access lists to control the traffic through the router&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you work with Cisco routers, you need a book like this to help you solve problems quickly and effectively.  Even if you're experienced, the solutions and extensive explanations will give you new ideas and insights into router configuration.  And if you're not experienced--if you've just been given responsibility for managing a network with Cisco routers--this book could be a job-saver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

It convey's Perl's special models and programming idioms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book isn't a collection of clever tricks, but a way of thinking about Perl programming so you can integrate the real-life problems of debugging, maintenance, configuration, and other tasks you encounter as a working programmer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The book explains how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use advanced regular expressions, including global matches, lookarounds, readable regexes, and regex debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid common programing problems with secure programming techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profile and benchmark Perl to find out where to focus your improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrangle Perl code to make it more presentable and readable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See how Perl keeps track of package variables and how you can use that for some powerful tricks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define subroutines on the fly and turn the tables on normal procedural programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify and jury rig modules to fix code without editing the original source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let your users configure your programs without touching the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how you can detect errors Perl doesn't report, and how to tell users about them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let your Perl program talk back to you by using Log4perl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store data for later use in another program, a later run of the same program, or to send them over a network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write programs as modules to get the benefit of Perl's distribution and testing tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Appendices include "brian's Guide to Solving Any Perl Problem" to improve your troubleshooting skills, as well as suggested reading to continue your Perl education. &lt;em&gt;Mastering Perl&lt;/em&gt; starts you on your path to becoming the person with the answers, and, failing that, the person who knows how to find the answers or discover the problem.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you used iPhoto when it first came out, you'll remember the way it slowed to a crawl once you loaded it with about 2,000 photos. Compare that to this year's model: iPhoto 6 can handle as many as 250,000 images and still have the power to run a host of suped-up features. Its new software engine lets you make changes with a drag &amp;amp; drop editing tool, find photos with a robust search feature, and manipulate images without affecting the originals in your master library. You can also:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;View and work on full-screen images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make quick edits with one click&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Work with RAW images&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Create cool new calendars, greeting cards and books&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Post photos online with the new iWeb application&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Use a method of sharing called "Photocasting"&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple makes it all sound so easy: just drag this, click that and you're done. But, as intuitive as these features are, you can still get lost, especially if you're new to iPhoto. Not to worry. &lt;i&gt;iPhoto 6: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; gives you plenty of undocumented tips &amp;amp; tricks for taking advantage of the new version and every little feature packed into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's the top-selling iPhoto book for good reason. With wit and objectivity, David Pogue and Derrick Story start you out with a crash course on digital photography, complete with tutorials on buying a camera, composing brilliant photos in various situations (sports, portraits, nighttime shots, even kid photography), and making digital movies. From there, you'll dive into every detail of iPhoto, from camera-meets-Mac basics to storing, searching, editing, and creating books, calendars and greeting cards. You'll learn to build a personal web site built with iWeb, and discover "Photocasting"-the new service that allows. Mac subscribers to publish photo albums online so that others can use the photos, even if they work on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With iPhoto 6, you could add 1000 photos a month for the next 20 years and not fill it. With &lt;i&gt;iPhoto 6: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt;, you can get going in no time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Along with its host of new features, iPhoto 6 can handle as many as 250,000 images. It's incredible, and Apple makes it sound so easy. But you can still get lost, especially if you're new to iPhoto. Not to worry.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the last version of iMovie gave moviemakers the ability to capture and edit widescreen High Definition Video (HDV) from the new generation of camcorders, iMovie 6 is all about the ease of moviemaking itself. iMovie 6 includes five professionally designed themes with backgrounds, motion graphics, titles, and effects that act as building blocks for your projects. You can preview transitions and stunning new video effects--such as time-lapse video--in real time using the full screen. Or edit audio and add sound effects with a new built-in sound studio. For presenting your movie, Magic iDVD offers easy-to-use themes, including new widescreen options. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a professional or an amateur moviemaker, this is amazing stuff. But if you want to learn the full capabilities of these applications, Apple documentation won't make the cut. Instead, &lt;i&gt;iMovie 6 &amp;amp; iDVD: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is the ideal third-party authority that covers all of these changes through an objective lens. This witty and entertaining guide from celebrated author David Pogue details every step of iMovie 6 and iDVD production. The book shows you how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on multiple iMovie projects at once and drag &amp;amp; drop clips among them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output your creation to a blog, its own web page, or as a video podcast with iWeb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use "Magic iMovie" to import your video and make a movie for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate with other iLife programs to use songs, photos, and an original soundtrack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And a whole lot more&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;From choosing and using a digital camcorder to burning the finished work onto DVDs, posting it online, or downloading it to an iPod, &lt;i&gt;iMovie 6 &amp;amp; iDVD: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; zooms right in on the details in a clear, concise, and understandable manner. The book also provides a firm grounding in basic film technique so that the quality of your video won't rely entirely on magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of using spacer GIFs, layers of nested tables, and other improvised solutions for building your web sites, getting used to the more stringent "standards-compliant" design that is de rigueur among professionals today can be intimidating.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With standards-driven design, keeping style separate from content is not just a possibility but a reality. You no longer use HTML and XHTML as design tools, but strictly as ways to define the meaning and structure of web content. And Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to page layout. When you follow the standards, both the site's design and underlying code are much cleaner. But how do you keep all those HTML and XHTML tags and CSS values straight? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jennifer Niederst-Robbins, the author of our definitive guide on standards-compliant design, &lt;i&gt;Web Design in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt;, offers you the perfect little guide when you need answers immediately: &lt;i&gt;HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt;. This revised and updated new edition takes the top 20% of vital reference information from her Nutshell book, augments it judiciously, cross-references everything, and organizes it according to the most common needs of web developers. The result is a handy book that offers the bare essentials on web standards in a small, concise format that you can use carry anywhere for quick reference. This guide will literally fit into your back pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Inside &lt;i&gt;HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt;, you'll find instantly accessible alphabetical listings of every element and attribute in the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 Recommendations. This is an indispensable reference for any serious web designer, author, or programmer who needs a fast on-the-job resource when working with established web standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;You're ready to make the move to much cleaner standards-compliant web design, but how do you keep all those HTML tags and CSS values straight? This handy pocket guide offers alphabetical listings of every element and attribute in the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 Recommendations. It's an indispensable reference for anyone working with web standards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone still think that Adobe Photoshop Elements is a toy version of the real thing? As the most popular photo-editing program on the market, Photoshop Elements not only has Photoshop's marvelous powers, but also has capabilities the mothership lacks. Each new version includes more tools designed specifically for today's consumer digital photo enthusiasts. The latest edition, Photoshop Elements 5, solidifies the reputation of this superb and inexpensive product with new scrapbook features, a link to online photo services, and many other improvements.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In fact, there's so much to Photoshop Elements that it can be quite confusing at times. That's precisely why our Missing Manuals are the bestselling books on the topic. Adobe provides a pamphlet and some help files; our book, now in its fifth edition, carefully explains every feature the program has to offer (something no other book has done) by putting each one into a clear, easy-to-understand context. &lt;i&gt;Photoshop Elements 5: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; covers the Windows version of Adobe's workhorse and gives you the low down on a host of new features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn to create multiple page documents, custom photo layouts with frames, and highly customized layouts for scrapbook projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master the new editor for Layer Styles, which lets you customize individual layers in a photo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Attach" your photos to areas of a Yahoo! Map so your friends and family can see the pictures you took in specific places&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Barbara Brundage also introduces you to a new sophisticated tool called "Curves" to adjust the color and contrast in your photos, and shows you how to burn multi-session CDs and DVDs. As always, she lets you know which features work well, which don't, and why -- all with a bit of wit and good humor. Although the book progresses from simple to complex tasks, you can easily jump around to learn specific techniques, such as creating photomontages (composites), restoring old photos, preparing images for the Web, and archiving. More than a dozen downloadable images let you practice using the editing tools right away!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

&lt;p&gt;Put everthing you need to know about HTML &amp;amp; XHTML at your fingertips.  For nearly a decade, hundreds of thousands of web developers have turned to &lt;i&gt;HTML &amp;amp; XHTML: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; to master standards-based web development.  Truly a definitive guide, the book combines a unique balance of tutorial material with a comprehensive reference that even the most experienced web professionals keep close at hand. From basic syntax and semantics to guidelines aimed at helping you develop your own distinctive style, this classic is all you need to become fluent in the language of web design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The new sixth edition guides you through every element of HTML and XHTML in detail, explaining how each element works and how it interacts with other elements. You'll also find detailed discussions of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is intricately related to web page development.  The most all-inclusive, up-to-date book on these languages available, this edition covers HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, and CSS2, with a preview of the upcoming XHTML2 and CSS3.  Other topics include the newer initiatives in XHTML (XForms, XFrames, and modularization) and the essentials of XML for advanced readers. You'll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use style sheets to control your document's appearance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with programmatically generated HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create tables, both simple and complex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use frames to coordinate sets of documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design and build interactive forms and dynamic documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert images, sound files, video, Java applets, and JavaScript programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create documents that look good on a variety of browsers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The authors apply a natural learning approach that uses straightforward language and plenty of examples. Throughout the book, they offer suggestions for style and composition to help you decide how to best use HTML and XHTML to accomplish a variety of tasks. You'll learn what works and what doesn't, and what makes sense to those who view your web pages and what might be confusing. Written for anyone who wants to learn the language of the Web--from casual users to the full-time design professionals--this is the single most important book on HTML and XHTML you can own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Updated to cover Internet Explorer 7, Microsoft's vastly improved browser, this new edition includes content on positioning, lists and generated content, table layout, user interface, paged media, and more.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a way to separate a document's structure from its presentation. The benefits of this can be quite profound: CSS allows a much richer document appearance than HTML and also saves time -- you can create or change the appearance of an entire document in just one place; and its compact file size makes web pages load quickly.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CSS: The Definitive Guide, 3rd Edition&lt;/em&gt;, provides you with a comprehensive guide to CSS implementation, along with a thorough review of all aspects of CSS 2.1. Updated to cover Internet Explorer 7, Microsoft's vastly improved browser, this new edition includes content on positioning, lists and generated content, table layout, user interface, paged media, and more. Author Eric Meyer tackles the subject with passion, exploring in detail each individual CSS property and how it interacts with other properties. You'll not only learn how to avoid common mistakes in interpretation, you also will benefit from the depth and breadth of his experience and his clear and honest style. This is the complete sourcebook on CSS.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3rd edition contains:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updates to reflect changes in the latest draft version of CSS 2.1&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the best developers have seen well-intentioned software projects fail -- often because the customer kept changing requirements, and end users didn't know how to use the software you developed. Instead of surrendering to these common problems, let &lt;em&gt;Head First Software Development&lt;/em&gt; guide you through the best practices of software development. Before you know it, those failed projects will be a thing of the past.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

You'll gain essential information about each step of the software development lifecycle -- requirements, design, coding, testing, implementing, and maintenance -- and understand why and how different development processes work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book is for you if you are:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tired of your customers assuming you're psychic. You'll learn not only how to get good requirements, but how to make sure you're always building the software that customers want (even when they're not sure themselves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wondering when the other 15 programmers you need to get your project done on time are going to show up. You'll learn how some very simple scheduling and prioritizing will revolutionize your success rate in developing software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confused about being rational, agile, or a tester. You'll learn not only about the various development methodologies out there, but how to choose a solution that's right for your project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confused because the way you ran your last project worked so well, but failed miserably this time around. You'll learn how to tackle each project individually, combine lessons you've learned on previous projects with cutting-edge development techniques, and end up with great software on &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head First Software Development&lt;/em&gt; is here to help you learn in a way that your brain likes... and you'll have a blast along the way. Why pick up hundreds of boring books on the philosophy of this approach or the formal techniques required for that one? Stick with &lt;em&gt;Head First Software Development&lt;/em&gt;, and your projects will succeed like never before. Go on, get started... you'll learn and have fun. We promise.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like every other application in Microsoft Office suite, PowerPoint is loaded with features. So many, in fact, that even veterans don't know where to find them all. Microsoft solved this problem in PowerPoint 2007 by redesigning the user interface with a tabbed toolbar that makes features easy to locate and use. PowerPoint 2007 also boasts improved graphics, additional templates, the ability to save custom layouts, and improved collaboration through SharePoint. One thing Microsoft hasn't improved is its poor documentation. To learn the ins and outs of all the features in PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft merely offers online help. If you're familiar with previous versions of the program, you may be lost the first time you fire up the new PowerPoint; or you would be if it weren't for &lt;em&gt;PowerPoint 2007: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book, written specifically for this version of the software, not only offers the basics of how to create, save, set up, run, and print a basic bullets-and-background slideshow, but takes you into the world of multimedia, animation, and interactivity. You'll learn how to add pictures, sound, video, animated effects, and controls (buttons and links) to their slides, along with ways to pull text, spreadsheets, and animations created in other programs. You can also create your own reusable design templates and learn to automate repetitive tasks with macros. Learn how to take advantage of advanced functions (such as adding custom background images) that existed in previous PowerPoint versions, but were so cleverly hidden that few people ever found them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Word has grown considerably in power, sophistication and capability over the past decade, but one thing that hasn't changed since the early '90s is its user interface. The simple toolbar in version 2.0 has been packed with so many features since then that few users know where to find them all. Consequently, more and more people are looking for "insider" tips that will allow them to use these advanced and often hidden features. Microsoft has addressed this problem in Word 2007 by radically redesigning the user interface with a tabbed toolbar that makes every feature easy to locate and use. Unfortunately, Microsoft's documentation is as scant as ever, so even though you will be able to find advanced features, you might not know what to do with them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Word 2007: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt;, written specifically for this version of the software, explains basics like how to create documents, enter and edit text, format, print, and fax. You will will also learn how to create sophisticated page layouts, insert forms and tables, use graphics, and create book-length documents with outlines and Master Documents. Coverage also includes how to share documents with other people and programs, create web pages, automate documents with fields, and automate tasks with macros and the Visual Basic scripting language. This book shows you how to do it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by popular author and .NET expert Jesse Liberty, this thoroughly updated tutorial for beginning to intermediate programmers covers the latest release of Microsoft's popular C# language (C# 3.0) and the newest .NET platform for developing Windows and web applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Our bestselling &lt;em&gt;Programming C# 3.0&lt;/em&gt;, now in its fifth edition, is a world-class tutorial that goes well beyond the documentation otherwise available. Liberty doesn't just teach C#; he tells the complete story of the C# language and how it integrates with all of .NET programming, so that you can get started creating professional quality web and Windows applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provides a comprehensive tutorial in C# and .NET programming that also serves as a useful reference you'll want by your side while you're working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covers all of the new features of the language, thoroughly integrated into every chapter, rather than tacked on at the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides insight into best practices and insight into real world programming by a professional programmer who worked with C# as an independent contractor for nearly a decade before joining Microsoft as a Senior Program Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every chapter in this book has been totally revised, and the entire book has been reorganized to respond to the significant changes in the language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full coverage, from the ground up of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and other C# 3.0 language innovations to speed up development tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explains how to use C# in creating Web Applications as well as Windows Applications, using both the new Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and the older WinForms technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This new edition of &lt;em&gt;Programming C# 3.0&lt;/em&gt; is for working programmers who want to develop proficiency in Microsoft's most important language. No prior .NET experience is required for you to get started. There's no time like the present to work with C# -- and no book like this one to teach you everything you need to know.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Special note to VB6 and Java programmers: if you've decided to transition to .NET, this book will take you there.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn to build dynamic, interactive web applications using the two most important approaches to web development today: Ajax and the phenomenally efficient Ruby on Rails platform. This book teaches intermediate to advanced web developers how to use both Ajax and Rails to quickly build high-performance, scalable applications without being overwhelmed with thousands of lines of JavaScript code. More than just recipes, you also get a thorough, low-level understanding of what's happening under the hood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ajax on Rails&lt;/i&gt; includes three fully worked out Rails/Ajax applications, and quick reference sections for Prototype and script.aculo.us.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Testing lessons show you how to eliminate cross-browser JavaScript errors and DOM debugging nightmares using a combination of Firebug, and Venkman.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Advanced material explains the most current design practices for Ajax usability. You'll learn to avoid user experience mistakes with proven design patterns.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the how-to, &lt;i&gt;Ajax on Rails&lt;/i&gt; helps you consider when Ajax is (and isn't) appropriate, and the trade-offs associated with it. For those new to Rails, this book provides a quick introduction, the big picture, a walk through the installation process, and some tips on getting started. If you've already started working with Rails and seek to deepen your skill set, you'll find dozens of examples drawn from real-world projects, exhaustive reference for every relevant feature, and expert advice on how to "Ajaxify" your applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of Java's Input/Output (I/O) facilities are based on streams, which provide simple ways to read and write data of different types. Java provides many different kinds of streams, each with its own application. The universe of streams is divided into four large
categories: input streams and output streams, for reading and writing binary data; and readers and writers, for reading and writing textual (character) data. You're almost certainly familiar with the basic kinds of streams--but did you know that there's a CipherInputStream for reading encrypted data? And a ZipOutputStream for automatically
compressing data? Do you know how to use buffered streams effectively to make your I/O operations more efficient? &lt;i&gt;Java I/O&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition has been updated for Java 5.0 APIs and tells you all you ever need to know about streams--and probably more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A discussion of I/O wouldn't be complete without treatment of character sets and formatting. Java supports the Unicode standard, which provides definitions for the character sets of most written languages. Consequently, Java is the first programming language that lets you do I/O in virtually any language. Java also provides a sophisticated model for formatting textual and numeric data. &lt;i&gt;Java I/O&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition shows you how to control number formatting, use characters aside from the standard (but outdated) ASCII character set, and get a head start on writing truly multilingual software. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java I/O&lt;/i&gt;, 2nd Edition includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coverage of all I/O classes and related classes&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;In-depth coverage of Java's number formatting facilities and its support for international character sets&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;.NET 3.5 will help you create better Windows applications, build Web Services that are more powerful, implement new Workflow projects and dramatically enhance the user's experience. But it does so with what appears to be a collection of disparate technologies. In &lt;em&gt;Programming .NET 3.5&lt;/em&gt;, bestselling author Jesse Liberty and industry expert Alex Horovitz uncover the common threads that unite the .NET 3.5 technologies, so you can benefit from the best practices and architectural patterns baked into this newest generation of Microsoft frameworks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
While single-topic .NET 3.5 books delve into Windows Presentation Foundation and the other frameworks in greater detail, &lt;em&gt;Programming .NET 3.5&lt;/em&gt; offers a "Grand Tour" of the release that describes how the four principal technologies can be used together, with Ajax, to build modern n-tier and service-oriented applications. Developers have struggled to implement these patterns with previous versions of the .NET Framework, but this hands-on guide uses real-world examples and fully annotated source code to demonstrate how .NET 3.5 can make it easy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The concepts and technologies that this book covers include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;XAML -- Microsoft's new XML-based markup language for UI, used with WPF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) -- a new presentation framework and graphics subsystem for Windows that puts Vista-like effect in your grasp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ajax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) - a new standards-based framework that enables applications to communicate across a network using a variety of protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workflow Foundation (WF) -- framework for defining, executing, and managing workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CardSpace -- framework for managing the identities of your users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You'll learn how to use each of the four frameworks alone and in concert to build a series of meaningful example applications. Examples are written in C#, and all of the source code will be available for download at both the O'Reilly and the authors' site, which offers access to a free support forum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Between them, authors Jesse Liberty and Alex Horovitz have nearly forty years of experience in delivering commercial applications for companies such as Citibank, Apple, AT&amp;amp;T, NeXt, PBS, Ziff Davis, and dozens of smaller organizations. Their combined experience is valuable for telling the story of .NET 3.5 and how it will shorten the development life cycle for applications developers, and enhance your productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a concise yet thorough reference to C# 3.0 programming as implemented in Microsoft's Visual Studio 2008. &lt;em&gt;C# 3.0 in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt; gets right to the point, covering the essentials of language syntax and usage as well as the parts of the .NET base class libraries you need to build working applications. But unlike earlier editions, this book is now organized entirely around concepts and use cases, providing greater depth and readability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
C# 3.0 introduces the most significant enhancements yet to the programming language, and &lt;em&gt;C# 3.0 in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt; delves deep into the subject while assuming minimal prior knowledge of C#-making it accessible to anyone with a reasonable background in programming. In addition to the language, the book covers the .NET CLR and the core Framework assemblies, along with the unified querying syntax called Language Integrated Query (LINQ), which bridges the traditional divide between programs and their data sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Free of clutter and long introductions, this book provides a map of C# 3.0 knowledge in a succinct and unified style:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Opening chapters concentrate purely on C#, starting with the basics of syntax, types and variables, and finishing with advanced topics such as unsafe code and preprocessor directives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Later chapters cover the core .NET 3.5 Framework, including such topics as LINQ, XML, collections, I/O and networking, memory management, reflection, attributes, security, threading, application domains and native interoperability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Designed as a handbook for daily use, &lt;em&gt;C# 3.0 in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt; is an ideal companion to any of the vast array of books that focus on an applied technology such as WPF, ASP.NET, or WCF. The areas of the language and .NET Framework that such books omit, this one covers in detail.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn't it be great if there were a statistics book that made histograms, probability distributions, and chi square analysis more enjoyable than going to the dentist? &lt;em&gt;Head First Statistics&lt;/em&gt; brings this typically dry subject to life, teaching you everything you want and need to know about statistics through engaging, interactive, and thought-provoking material, full of puzzles, stories, quizzes, visual aids, and real-world examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Whether you're a student, a professional, or just curious about statistical analysis, Head First's brain-friendly formula helps you get a firm grasp of statistics so you can understand key points and actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; them. Learn to present data visually with charts and plots; discover the difference between taking the average with mean, median, and mode, and why it's important; learn how to calculate probability and expectation; and much more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head First Statistics&lt;/em&gt; is ideal for high school and college students taking statistics and satisfies the requirements for passing the College Board's Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics Exam. With this book, you'll:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Study the full range of topics covered in first-year statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tackle tough statistical concepts using Head First's dynamic, visually rich format proven to stimulate learning and help you retain knowledge &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore real-world scenarios, ranging from casino gambling to prescription drug testing, to bring statistical principles to life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover how to measure spread, calculate odds through probability, and understand the normal, binomial, geometric, and Poisson distributions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct sampling, use correlation and regression, do hypothesis testing, perform chi square analysis, and more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you know it, you'll not only have mastered statistics, you'll also see how they work in the real world. &lt;em&gt;Head First Statistics&lt;/em&gt; will help you pass your statistics course, and give you a firm understanding of the subject so you can apply the knowledge throughout your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Excel continues to grow in power, sophistication, and capability, but one thing that has changed very little since the early '90s is its user interface. The once-simple toolbar has been packed with so many features over the years that few users know where to find them all. Microsoft has addressed this problem in Excel 2007 by radically redesigning the user interface with a tabbed toolbar that makes every feature easy to locate and use. Unfortunately, Microsoft's documentation is as scant as ever, so even if users can find advanced features, they probably won't know what to do with them.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Excel 2007: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; covers the entire gamut of how to build spreadsheets, add and format information, print reports, create charts and graphics, and use basic formulas and functions. Like its siblings in the Missing Manual series, this book crackles with a fine sense of humor and refreshing objectivity about its subject, guiding readers through the new Excel with clear explanations, step-by-step instructions, lots of illustrations, and friendly, time-saving advice. It's a perfect primer for small businesses with no techie to turn to, as well as those who want to organize household and office information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to industrial-strength database products such as Microsoft's SQL Server, Access is a breeze to use. It runs on PCs rather than servers and is ideal for small- to mid-sized businesses and households. But Access is still intimidating to learn. It doesn't help that each new version crammed in yet another set of features; so many, in fact, that even the pros don't know where to find them all. Access 2007 breaks this pattern with some of the most dramatic changes users have seen since Office 95. Most obvious is the thoroughly redesigned user interface, with its tabbed toolbar (or "Ribbon") that makes features easy to locate and use. The features list also includes several long-awaited changes. One thing that hasn't improved is Microsoft's documentation. To learn the ins and outs of all the features in Access 2007, Microsoft merely offers online help.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Access 2007: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; was written from the ground up for this redesigned application. You will learn how to design complete databases, maintain them, search for valuable nuggets of information, and build attractive forms for quick-and-easy data entry. You'll even delve into the black art of Access programming (including macros and Visual Basic), and pick up valuable tricks and techniques to automate common tasks -- even if you've never touched a line of code before. You will also learn all about the new prebuilt databases you can customize to fit your needs, and how the new complex data feature will simplify your life. With plenty of downloadable examples, this objective and witty book will turn an Access neophyte into a true master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fast-moving world of computers, things are always changing. Since the first edition of this strong-selling book appeared two years ago, network security techniques and tools have evolved rapidly to meet new and more sophisticated threats that pop up with alarming regularity. The second edition offers both new and thoroughly updated hacks for Linux, Windows, OpenBSD, and Mac OS X servers that not only enable readers to secure TCP/IP-based services, but helps them implement a good deal of clever host-based security techniques as well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This second edition of &lt;em&gt;Network Security Hacks&lt;/em&gt; offers 125 concise and practical hacks, including more information for Windows administrators, hacks for wireless networking (such as setting up a captive portal and securing against rogue hotspots), and techniques to ensure privacy and anonymity, including ways to evade network traffic analysis, encrypt email and files, and protect against phishing attacks. System administrators looking for reliable answers will also find concise examples of applied encryption, intrusion detection, logging, trending and incident response. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Art of Agile Development</title>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Art of Agile Development&lt;/em&gt; contains practical guidance for anyone considering or applying agile development for building valuable software. Plenty of books describe what agile development is or why it helps software projects succeed, but very few combine information for developers, managers, testers, and customers into a single package that they can apply directly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book provides no-nonsense advice on agile planning, development, delivery, and management taken from the authors' many years of experience with Extreme Programming (XP). You get a gestalt view of the agile development process, including comprehensive guidance for non-technical readers and hands-on technical practices for developers and testers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Art of Agile Development gives you clear answers to questions such as:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can we adopt agile development?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we really need to pair program?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What metrics should we report?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if I can't get my customer to participate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much documentation should we write?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When do we design and architect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a non-developer, how should I work with my agile team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where is my product roadmap?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does QA fit in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The book teaches you how to adopt XP practices, describes each practice in detail, then discusses principles that will allow you to modify XP and create your own agile method. In particular, this book tackles the difficult aspects of agile development: the need for cooperation and trust among team members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Whether you're currently part of an agile team, working with an agile team, or interested in agile development, this book provides the practical tips you need to start practicing agile development. As your experience grows, the book will grow with you, providing exercises and information that will teach you first to understand the rules of agile development, break them, and ultimately abandon rules altogether as you master the art of agile development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Jim Shore and Shane Warden expertly explain the practices and benefits of Extreme Programming. They offer advice from their real-world experiences in leading teams. They answer questions about the practices and show contraindications - ways that a practice may be mis-applied. They offer alternatives you can try if there are impediments to applying a practice, such as the lack of an on-site customer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Ken Pugh, Author of Jolt Award Winner, &lt;em&gt;Prefactoring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"I will leave a copy of this book with every team I visit."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Brian Marick, Exampler Consulting&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Plenty of books describe what agile development is or why it helps software projects succeed, but very few combine information for developers, managers, testers, and customers into a single package that they can apply directly. This book provides a gestalt view of the agile development process that serves as a comprehensive introduction for non-technical readers, along with hands-on technical practices for programmers and developers. The book also tackles the people aspect of Extreme Programming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Clear and concise, this highly visual book explains how color management is a part of the overall photographic workflow. Eddie demonstrates the three stages of color managed workflow, from choosing a color space, to calibrating your devices, to applying appropriate profiles, and shows you exactly what you need to know and why you need to know it. Color management scientist Rick Lucas contributes a chapter on the hard-core technical aspects. Other books on color management are much too long, involved and intimidating. This absorbing book sets the right tone and supplies you with key answers quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our &lt;em&gt;Eddie Tapp on Digital Photography&lt;/em&gt; book series brings you the focused knowledge you need on specific areas of digital photography. Acknowledged as one of the premier trainers of digital imaging in the world, Eddie brings his teaching experience to bear on issues that other books gloss over or bury under general coverage. Now, you don't have to buy a doorstop-sized book to get the key information you need on color management, efficient workflow, or a variety of other specific digital imaging topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eddie Tapp on Digital Photography&lt;/em&gt; also covers workflow setup; advanced and professional production techniques; controlling digital color and tone; creative enhancement techniques; and more. This series is a perfect complement to O'Reilly's general list on Photoshop and digital photography, and offers you focused books that cover technical issues at prices that are affordable and solutions that are quickly accessible. We're thrilled that Eddie Tapp has finally agreed to publish books -- and with O'Reilly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you're ready to make the leap from writing HTML and CSS web pages to creating dynamic web applications. You want to take your web skills to the next level. And you're finally ready to add "programmer" to the resume. It sounds like you're ready to learn the Web's hottest programming language: JavaScript. &lt;em&gt;Head First JavaScript&lt;/em&gt; is your ticket to going beyond copying and pasting the code from someone else's web site, and writing your own interactive web pages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With Head First JavaScript, you learn:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The basics of programming, from variables to types to looping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the web browser runs your code, and how you can talk to the browser with your code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why you'll never have to worry about casting, overloading, or polymorphism when you're writing JavaScript code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use the Document Object Model to change your web pages without making your users click buttons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
If you've ever read a Head First book, you know what to expect -- a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. &lt;em&gt;Head First JavaScript&lt;/em&gt; is no exception. It starts where HTML and CSS leave off, and takes you through your first program into more complex programming concepts -- like working directly with the web browser's object model and writing code that works on all modern browsers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Don't be intimidated if you've never written a line of code before! In typical Head First style, Head First JavaScript doesn't skip steps, and we're not interested in having you cut and paste code. You'll learn JavaScript, understand it, and have a blast along the way. So get ready... dynamic and exciting web pages are just pages away.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive guide shows you how to master the most important
changes to Java since it was first released.  Generics and the greatly
expanded collection libraries have tremendously increased the power of
Java 5 and Java 6.  But they have also confused many developers who
haven't known how to take advantage of these new features.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Java Generics and Collections&lt;/i&gt; covers everything from the most
basic uses of generics to the strangest corner cases.  It teaches you
everything you need to know about the collections libraries, so you'll
always know which collection is appropriate for any given task, and
how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fundamentals of generics: type parameters and generic methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other new features: boxing and unboxing, foreach loops, varargs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subtyping and wildcards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolution not revolution: generic libraries with legacy clients and
generic clients with legacy libraries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generics and reflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design patterns for generics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sets, Queues, Lists, Maps, and their implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concurrent programming and thread safety with collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance implications of different collections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generics and the new collection libraries they inspired take Java to a
new level.  If you want to take your software development practice to
a new level, this book is essential reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Philip Wadler&lt;/b&gt; is Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at the
University of Edinburgh, where his research focuses on the design of
programming languages.  He is a co-designer of GJ, work that
became the basis for generics in Sun's Java 5.0.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maurice Naftalin&lt;/b&gt; is Technical Director at Morningside Light Ltd., a software consultancy in the United Kingdom.  He has most recently served as an architect and mentor at NSB Retail Systems plc, and as the leader of the client development team of a major UK government social service system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;"A brilliant exposition of generics. By far the best book on the
topic, it provides a crystal clear tutorial that starts with the
basics and ends leaving the reader with a deep understanding of both
the use and design of generics."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, authors Rich Shupe and Zevan Rosser share the knowledge they've gained from their years as multimedia developers/designers and teachers. &lt;em&gt;Learning ActionScript 3.0&lt;/em&gt; gives you a solid foundation in the language of Flash and demonstrates how you can use it for practical, everyday projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The authors do more than just give you a collection of sample scripts. Written for those of you new to ActionScript 3.0, the book describes how ActionScript and Flash work, giving you a clear look into essential topics such as logic, event handling, displaying content, migrating legacy projects to ActionScript 3.0, classes, and much more. You will learn important techniques through hands-on exercises, and then build on those skills as chapters progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
ActionScript 3.0 represents a significant change for many Flash users, and a steeper learning curve for the uninitiated. This book will help guide you through a variety of scripting scenarios.  Rather than relying heavily on prior knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP), topics are explained in focused examples that originate in the timeline, with optional companion classes for those already comfortable with their use. As chapters progress, the book introduces more and more OOP techniques, allowing you to choose which scripting approach you prefer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning ActionScript 3.0&lt;/em&gt; reveals:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New ways to harness the power and performance of AS3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common mistakes that people make with the language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential coverage of text, sound, video, XML, drawing with code, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migration issues from AS1 and AS2 to AS3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simultaneous development of procedural and object-oriented techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips that go beyond simple script collections, including how to approach a project and which resources can help you along the way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The companion web site contains material for all the exercises in the book, as well as short quizzes to make sure you're up to speed with key concepts. ActionScript 3.0 is a different animal from previous versions, and &lt;em&gt;Learning ActionScript 3.0&lt;/em&gt; teaches everything that web designers, GUI-based Flash developers, and those new to ActionScript need to start using the language.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning ActionScript 3.0&lt;/em&gt; gives you a solid foundation in the Flash language and demonstrates how you can use it for practical, everyday projects. The book does more than give you a handful of sample scripts, defining how ActionScript and Flash work. It gives you a clear look into essential topics such as logic, event handling, displaying content, migrating legacy projects to ActionScript 3.0, classes, and much more. Written for those new to the language, this book doesn't rely exclusively on prior knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP). Instead, it helps you expand your skillset by first focusing on clear, concise examples in the timeline, evolving into OOP examples over time-allowing you to choose the programming approach with which you are most comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoroughly rewritten for today's web environment, this bestselling book offers a fresh look at a fundamental topic of web site development: navigation design. Amid all the changes to the Web in the past decade, and all the hype about Web 2.0 and various "rich" interactive technologies, the basic problems of creating a good web navigation system remain. Designing Web Navigation demonstrates that good navigation is not about technology-it's about the ways people find information, and how you guide them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Ideal for beginning to intermediate web designers, managers, other non-designers, and web development pros looking for another perspective, &lt;em&gt;Designing Web Navigation&lt;/em&gt; offers basic design principles, development techniques and practical advice, with real-world examples and essential concepts seamlessly folded in. How does your web site serve your business objectives? How does it meet a user's needs? You'll learn that navigation design touches most other aspects of web site development. This book:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provides the foundations of web navigation and offers a framework for navigation design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paints a broad picture of web navigation and basic human information behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrates how navigation reflects brand and affects site credibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps you understand the problem you're trying to solve before you set out to design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thoroughly reviews the mechanisms and different types of navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explores "information scent" and "information shape"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explains "persuasive" architecture and other design concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covers special contexts, such as navigation design for web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Includes an entire chapter on tagging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
While &lt;em&gt;Designing Web Navigation&lt;/em&gt; focuses on creating navigation systems for large, information-rich sites serving a business purpose, the principles and techniques in the book also apply to small sites. Well researched and cited, this book serves as an excellent reference on the topic, as well as a superb teaching guide. Each chapter ends with suggested reading and a set of questions that offer exercises for experiencing the concepts in action.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular expressions are an extremely powerful tool for manipulating text and data. They are now standard features in a wide range of languages and popular tools, including Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, VB.NET and C# (and any language using the .NET Framework), PHP, and MySQL.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you don't use regular expressions yet, you will discover in this book a whole new world of mastery over your data. If you already use them, you'll appreciate this book's unprecedented detail and breadth of coverage. If you think you know all you need to know about regular
expressions, this book is a stunning eye-opener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As this book shows, a command of regular expressions is an invaluable skill. Regular expressions allow you to code complex and subtle text processing that you never imagined could be automated. Regular expressions can save you time and aggravation. They can be used to craft elegant solutions to a wide range of problems. Once you've mastered regular expressions, they'll become an invaluable part of your toolkit. You will wonder how you ever got by without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yet despite their wide availability, flexibility, and unparalleled power, regular expressions are frequently underutilized. Yet what is power in the hands of an expert can be fraught with peril for the unwary. &lt;i&gt;Mastering Regular Expressions&lt;/i&gt; will help you navigate the minefield to becoming an expert and help you optimize your use of regular expressions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mastering Regular Expressions&lt;/i&gt;, Third Edition, now includes a full chapter devoted to PHP and its powerful and expressive suite of regular expression functions, in addition to enhanced PHP coverage in the central "core" chapters. Furthermore, this edition has been updated throughout to reflect advances in other languages, including expanded in-depth coverage of Sun's &lt;i&gt;java.util.regex&lt;/i&gt; package, which has emerged as the standard Java regex implementation.Topics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A comparison of features among different versions of many languages and tools&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How the regular expression engine works&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimization (major savings available here!)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Matching just what you want, but not what you don't want&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sections and chapters on individual languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Written in the lucid, entertaining tone that makes a complex, dry topic become crystal-clear to programmers, and sprinkled with solutions to complex real-world problems, &lt;i&gt;Mastering Regular Expressions&lt;/i&gt;, Third Edition offers a wealth information that you can put to immediate
use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reviews of this new edition and the second edition:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"There isn't a better (or more useful) book available on regular expressions."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Zak Greant, Managing Director, eZ Systems
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A real tour-de-force of a book which not only covers the mechanics of regexes in extraordinary detail but also talks about efficiency and the use of regexes in Perl, Java, and .NET...If you use regular expressions as part of your professional work (even if you already have a good book on whatever language you're programming in) I would strongly recommend this book to you."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Dr. Chris Brown, &lt;i&gt;Linux Format&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
"The author does an outstanding job leading the reader from regex
novice to master. The book is extremely easy to read and chock full of
useful and relevant examples...Regular expressions are valuable tools
that every developer should have in their toolbox. &lt;i&gt;Mastering Regular
Expressions&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive guide to the subject, and an outstanding
resource that belongs on every programmer's bookshelf. Ten out of Ten
Horseshoes."
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Jason Menard, &lt;i&gt;Java Ranch&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

It provides all the information you need to get ready for these exams, including the four new A+ exams -- the required Essentials exam and three elective exams that pertain to your area of specialization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
As with other O'Reilly Nutshell books for certification exams, &lt;em&gt;A+, Network+ and Security + in a Nutshell&lt;/em&gt; follows a proven style and approach. It reviews all of the topics needed to master each exam in a remarkably concise format, with required knowledge boiled down to the core. Instead of plowing through 500 to 700 pages to prepare for each exam, this book covers each one in approximately 150 pages. And because the objectives for the three elective A+ exams are redundant, and the book covers them in one section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The exams covered include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A+ Essentials: Required for A+ 2006 certification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EXAM 220-602: For the A+ IT Technician specialization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EXAM 220-603: For the A+ Remote Support Technician specialization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EXAM 220-604: For the A+ IT Depot specialization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EXAM N10-003: For Network+ Certification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EXAM SYO-101: For Security+ Certification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Each exam is covered in three parts: Exam Overview, Study Guide and Prep and Practice. Plenty of detailed tables and screen shots are included, along with study notes and practice questions. Once you have completed the exams successfully, you will find this all-in-one book to be a valuable reference to core administration and security skills.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Vista is Microsoft's most important software release in more than a decade. It offers users an abundance of new and upgraded features that were more than five years in the making: a gorgeous, glass-like visual overhaul; superior searching and organization tools; a multimedia and collaboration suite; and above all, a  massive, top-to-bottom security-shield overhaul. There's scarcely a single feature of  the older versions of Windows that hasn't been tweaked, overhauled, or replaced entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
But when users first encounter this beautiful new operating system, there's gonna be a whole lotta head-scratchin', starting with trying to figure out which of the five versions of Vista is installed on the PC (Home, Premium, Business, Enterprise, Ultimate). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thankfully, &lt;em&gt;Windows Vista: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt; offers coverage of all five versions. Like its predecessors, this book from New York Times columnist, bestselling author, and Missing Manuals creator David Pogue illuminates its subject with technical insight, plenty of wit, and hardnosed objectivity for beginners, veteran standalone PC users, and those who know their way around a network. Readers will learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Navigate Vista's elegant new desktop
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Locate anything on your hard drive quickly with the fast, powerful, and fully integrated search function
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use the Media Center to record TV and radio, present photos, play music, and record any of the above to DVD
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chat, videoconference, and surf the Web with the vastly improved Internet Explorer 7 tabbed browser
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build a network for file sharing, set up workgroups, and connect from the road
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protect your PC and network with Vista's beefed up security
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And much more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This jargon-free guide explains Vista's features clearly and thoroughly, revealing which work well and which don't. It's the book that should have been in the box!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

It also offers a staggering array of advanced features that were once found only in page layout programs and graphics software. Many of these features are hidden among Word's cluttered menus, and even the pros can't find them all. For Word 2007, Microsoft redesigned the user interface completely, adding a tabbed toolbar that makes every feature easy to locate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Microsoft's documentation is as poor as ever, so even if you find the features you need, you still may not know what to do with them. &lt;i&gt;Word 2007 for Starters: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; helps you master Word's redesigned user interface and gives you exactly what you need to create unique, attractive and effective documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fast-paced book teaches you the basics of Access 2007 so you can start using this popular database program right away. You'll learn how to work with Access' most useful features to design databases, maintain them, search for valuable nuggets of information, and build attractive forms for quick-and-easy data entry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The new Access is radically different from previous versions, but with this book, you'll breeze through the new interface and its timesaving features in no time with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clear explanations&lt;/li&gt;

Ideal for small businesses and households, Access runs on PCs and manages large stores information, including numbers, pages of text, and pictures -- everything from a list of family phone numbers to an enormous product catalog. Unfortunately, each new version of the program crammed in yet another set of features -- so many that even the pros don't know where to find them all. Access 2007 breaks the mold: Microsoft changed the user interface by designing a tabbed toolbar that makes features easy to locate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that hasn't improved is Microsoft's documentation. Even if you find the features you need, you still may not know what to do with them. &lt;i&gt;Access 2007 for Starters: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is the perfect primer for small businesses with no techie to turn to, as well as those who want to organize household and office information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schedules, budgets, communications, resources. Projects big and small include them all, and Microsoft Project 2007 can help you control these variables -- not be controlled by them. But Project is complex software, and learning it is, well, a project in itself. Get up to speed fast with &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Project 2007: The Missing Manual&lt;/em&gt;. Written by project management expert Bonnie Biafore, this book teaches you how to do everything from setting budgets and tracking schedules to testing scenarios and recognizing trouble spots before your project breaks down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Find out what's new in Project 2007 from previous versions, and get help choosing the right edition, whether it's Project Standard, Project Professional, or Enterprise Project Management Solution. With Microsoft Project 2007: The Missing Manual, you get more than a simple software how-to. You also get a rundown on project management basics and plenty of solid advice on how to use Project to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Define your project and plan your approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Estimate your project, set up a budget, define tasks, and break the work into manageable chunks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a schedule, define the sequence of work, and learn the right way to use date constraints and deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a project team and assign resources to tasks: "who does what"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refine the project to satisfy objectives by building reality into the schedule, and learn to keep project costs under control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track progress and communicate with team members via reports, information sharing, and meetings that work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close out your project and take away valuable lessons for the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Microsoft Project 2007 is the flagship of all project management programs, and this Missing Manual is the book that should have been in the box. No project manager should be without it.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Project 2007&lt;/em&gt; helps users control the variables on any project, big or small -- such as schedules, budgets, communications, and changes -- rather than be controlled by them.

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Ajax a new technology, or the same old stuff web developers have been using for years? Both, actually. This book demonstrates not only how tried-and-true web standards make Ajax possible, but how these older technologies allow you to give sites a decidedly modern Web 2.0 feel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ajax: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; explains how to use standards like JavaScript, XML, CSS, and XHTML, along with the XMLHttpRequest object, to build browser-based web applications that function like desktop programs. You get a complete background on what goes into today's web sites and applications, and learn to leverage these tools along with Ajax for advanced browser searching, web services, mashups, and more. You discover how to turn a web browser and web site into a true application, and why developing with Ajax is faster, easier and cheaper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The book also explains:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to connect server-side backend components to user interfaces in the browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loading and manipulating XML documents, and how to replace XML with JSON&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing Ajax interfaces for usability, functionality, visualization, and accessibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Site navigation layout, including issues with Ajax and the browser's back button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding life to tables &amp;amp; lists, navigation boxes and windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animation creation, interactive forms, and data validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search, web services and mash-ups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applying Ajax to business communications, and creating Internet games without plug-ins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The advantages of modular coding, ways to optimize Ajax applications, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This book also provides references to XML and XSLT, popular JavaScript Frameworks, Libraries, and Toolkits, and various Web Service APIs. By offering web developers a much broader set of tools and options, Ajax gives developers a new way to create content on the Web, while throwing off the constraints of the past. &lt;em&gt;Ajax: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt; describes the contents of this unique toolbox in exhaustive detail, and explains how to get the most out of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Ajax builds on older technologies and techniques but reaches a tipping point where the results are new. This book gives you a boost to this next stage of web application development, teaching you how tried-and-true web standards not only make Ajax possible, but why developing with them is faster, easier and cheaper. Learn to build browser-based applications that function like desktop programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you're an experienced Flash or Flex developer ready to tackle sophisticated programming techniques with ActionScript 3.0, this hands-on introduction to design patterns is the book you need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;ActionScript 3.0 Design Patterns&lt;/em&gt; takes you step by step through the process, first by explaining how design patterns provide a clear road map for structuring code that actually makes OOP languages easier to learn and use. You then learn about various types of design patterns and construct small abstract examples before trying your hand at building full-fledged working applications outlined in the book. Topics in &lt;em&gt;ActionScript 3.0 Design Patterns&lt;/em&gt; include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key features of ActionScript 3.0 and why it became an OOP language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OOP characteristics, such as classes, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefits of using design patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creational patterns, including Factory and Singleton patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structural patterns, including Decorator, Adapter, and Composite patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behavioral patterns, including Command, Observer, Strategy, and State patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple design patterns, including Model-View-Controller and Symmetric Proxy designs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
During the course of the book, you'll work with examples of increasing complexity, such as an e-business application with service options that users can select, an interface for selecting a class of products and individual products in each class, an action game application, a video record and playback application, and many more. Whether you're coming to Flash and Flex from Java or C++, or have experience with ActionScript 2.0, &lt;em&gt;ActionScript 3.0 Design Patterns&lt;/em&gt; will have you constructing truly elegant solutions for your Flash and Flex applications in no time.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;If you're an experienced Flash or Flex developer ready to tackle sophisticated programming techniques with ActionScript 3.0, this hands-on introduction to design patterns takes you step by step through the process.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Moodle&lt;/em&gt; is a complete, hands-on guide for instructors learning how to use Moodle, the popular course management system (CMS) that enables remote web-based learning and supplements traditional classroom learning. Updated for the latest version, this new edition explains exactly how Moodle works by offering plenty of examples, screenshots and best practices for its many features and plug-in modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Moodle gives teachers and trainers a powerful set of web-based tools for a flexible array of activities, including assignments, forums, journals, quizzes, surveys, chat rooms, and workshops. This book is not just a how-to manual. Every chapter includes suggestions and case studies for using Moodle effectively. By itself, Moodle won't make your course better. Only by applying effective educational practices can you truly leverage its power. With this book, you will:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get a complete overview CMS in general and Moodle in particular. Review Moodle's basic interface and learn to start a course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn to add Moodle tools to your course, and how different tools allow you to give quizzes and assignments, write journals, create pathed lessons, collaboratively develop documents, and record student grades.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Discover some of the creative ways teachers have used Moodle. There are plenty of ideas for effectively using each tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effectively manage your Moodle course, such as adding and removing users, and creating user groups. Learn to use Moodle's built-in survey functions for assessing your class.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find out how to administer an entire Moodle site. A system administrator usually handles these functions, but if you're on your own, there's a lot of power behind the curtain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Moodle&lt;/em&gt; is both a guide and a reference manual for this incredibly powerful and flexible CMS. Authored by the Moodle community, this authoritative book also exposes little known but powerful hacks for more technically savvy users, and includes coverage of blogs, RSS, databases, and more. For anyone who is using, or thinking of using, this CMS, &lt;em&gt;Using Moodle&lt;/em&gt; is required reading.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>RESTful Web Services</title>

      <subject>COMPUTERS</subject>
      <subject>Web</subject>
      <subject>General</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every developer working with the Web needs to read this book."
-- David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of the Rails framework&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"RESTful Web Services finally provides a practical roadmap for constructing services that embrace the Web, instead of trying to route around it."
-- Adam Trachtenberg, PHP author and EBay Web Services Evangelist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
You've built web sites that can be used by humans. But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what &lt;em&gt;RESTful Web Services&lt;/em&gt; shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today's web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don't work like the Web, and they're missing out on its advantages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book puts the "Web" back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is REST, the architectural style that drives the Web. This book:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emphasizes the power of basic Web technologies -- the HTTP application protocol, the URI naming standard, and the XML markup language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), a common-sense set of rules for designing RESTful web services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows how a RESTful design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Includes real-world examples of RESTful web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shows how to implement RESTful services in three popular frameworks -- Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement RESTful web services and clients&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This is the first book that applies the REST design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it. This book shows you how.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want your web site to display more quickly? This book presents 14 specific rules that will cut 25% to 50% off response time when users request a page. Author Steve Souders, in his job as Chief Performance Yahoo!, collected these best practices while optimizing some of the most-visited pages on the Web. Even sites that had already been highly optimized, such as Yahoo! Search and the Yahoo! Front Page, were able to benefit from these surprisingly simple performance guidelines.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The rules in &lt;em&gt;High Performance Web Sites&lt;/em&gt; explain how you can optimize the performance of the Ajax, CSS, JavaScript, Flash, and images that you've already built into your site -- adjustments that are critical for any rich web application. Other sources of information pay a lot of attention to tuning web servers, databases, and hardware, but the bulk of display time is taken up on the browser side and by the communication between server and browser. &lt;em&gt;High Performance Web Sites&lt;/em&gt; covers every aspect of that process.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Each performance rule is supported by specific examples, and code snippets are available on the book's companion web site. The rules include how to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make Fewer HTTP Requests
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a Content Delivery Network
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add an Expires Header
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gzip Components
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put Stylesheets at the Top
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put Scripts at the Bottom
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid CSS Expressions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make JavaScript and CSS External
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce DNS Lookups
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minify JavaScript
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid Redirects
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remove Duplicates Scripts
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configure ETags
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make Ajax Cacheable
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you're building pages for high traffic destinations and want to optimize the experience of users visiting your site, this book is indispensable.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"If everyone would implement just 20% of Steve's guidelines, the Web would be a
dramatically better place. Between this book and Steve's YSlow extension, there's really
no excuse for having a sluggish web site anymore."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
-Joe Hewitt, Developer of Firebug debugger and Mozilla's DOM Inspector
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
"Steve Souders has done a fantastic job of distilling a massive, semi-arcane art down to a set of concise, actionable, pragmatic engineering steps that will change the world of web performance."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
-Eric Lawrence, Developer of the Fiddler Web Debugger, Microsoft Corporation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajax applications should be open yet secure. Far too often security is added as an afterthought. Potential flaws need to be identified and addressed right away. This book explores Ajax and web application security with an eye for dangerous gaps and offers ways that you can plug them before they become a problem. By making security part of the process from the start, you will learn how to build secure Ajax applications and discover how to respond quickly when attacks occur.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Securing Ajax Applications&lt;/em&gt; succinctly explains that the same back-and-forth communications that make Ajax so responsive also gives invaders new opportunities to gather data, make creative new requests of your server, and interfere with the communications between you and your customers. This book presents basic security techniques and examines vulnerabilities with JavaScript, XML, JSON, Flash, and other technologies -- vital information that will ultimately save you time and money.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An overview of the evolving web platform, including APIs, feeds, web services and asynchronous messaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web security basics, including common vulnerabilities, common cures, state management and session management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to secure web technologies, such as Ajax, JavaScript, Java applets, Active X controls, plug-ins, Flash and Flex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to protect your server, including front-line defense, dealing with application servers, PHP and scripting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vulnerabilities among web standards such as HTTP, XML, JSON, RSS, ATOM, REST, and XDOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to secure web services, build secure APIs, and make open mashups secure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Securing Ajax Applications takes&lt;/em&gt; on the challenges created by this new generation of web development, and demonstrates why web security isn't just for administrators and back-end programmers any more. It's also for web developers who accept the responsibility that comes with using the new wonders of the Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to tap the power behind search rankings, product recommendations, social bookmarking, and online matchmaking? This fascinating book demonstrates how you can build Web 2.0 applications to mine the enormous amount of data created by people on the Internet. With the sophisticated algorithms in this book, you can write smart programs to access interesting datasets from other web sites, collect data from users of your own applications, and analyze and understand the data once you've found it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Programming Collective Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; takes you into the world of machine learning and statistics, and explains how to draw conclusions about user experience, marketing, personal tastes, and human behavior in general -- all from information that you and others collect every day. Each algorithm is described clearly and concisely with code that can immediately be used on your web site, blog, Wiki, or specialized application. This book explains:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborative filtering techniques that enable online retailers to recommend products or media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods of clustering to detect groups of similar items in a large dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search engine features -- crawlers, indexers, query engines, and the PageRank algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimization algorithms that search millions of possible solutions to a problem and choose the best one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bayesian filtering, used in spam filters for classifying documents based on word types and other features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using decision trees not only to make predictions, but to model the way decisions are made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predicting numerical values rather than classifications to build price models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support vector machines to match people in online dating sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-negative matrix factorization to find the independent features in a dataset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolving intelligence for problem solving -- how a computer develops its skill by improving its own code the more it plays a game&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Each chapter includes exercises for extending the algorithms to make them more powerful. Go beyond simple database-backed applications and put the wealth of Internet data to work for you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Bravo! I cannot think of a better way for a developer to first learn these algorithms and methods, nor can I think of a better way for me (an old AI dog) to reinvigorate my knowledge of the details."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Dan Russell, Google
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Toby's book does a great job of breaking down the complex subject matter of machine-learning algorithms into practical, easy-to-understand examples that can be directly applied to analysis of social interaction across the Web today.  If I had this book two years ago, it would have saved precious time going down some fruitless paths."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ajax can bring many advantages to an existing web application without forcing you to redo the whole thing. This book explains how you can add Ajax to enhance, rather than replace, the way your application works. For instance, if you have a traditional web application based on submitting a form to update a table, you can enhance it by adding the capability to update the table with changes to the form fields, without actually having to submit the form. That's just one example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adding Ajax&lt;/em&gt; is for those of you more interested in extending existing applications than in creating Rich Internet Applications (RIA). You already know the "business-side" of applications-web forms, server-side driven pages, and static content-and now you want to make your web pages livelier, more fun, and much more interactive. This book:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provides an overview of Ajax technologies, and the importance of developing a strategy for changing your site before you sit down to code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explains the heart and soul of Ajax: how to work with the XMLHttpRequest object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduces and demonstrates several important Ajax libraries, including Prototype, script.aculo.us, rico, Mochikit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explores the interactive element that is Ajax, including how to work with events and event handlers that work across browsers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduces the concept of web page as space, and covers three popular approaches to managing web space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explains how to make data updates, including adding new data, deleting, and making updates, all from within a single page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describes the effects Ajax has on the Web-breaking the back button, losing browser history, dynamic effects that disappear when the page is refreshed, and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covers advanced CSS effects, including drag and drop "scroll bars", pagination, and the use of SVG and the Canvas object&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explores mashups-Ajax's ability to combine data from different web services in any number of ways, directly in our web pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
You don't need to start over to use Ajax. You can simply add to what you already have. This book explains how.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book demonstrates service-oriented architecture (SOA) as a concrete discipline rather than a hopeful collection of cloud charts. Built upon the author's firsthand experience rolling out a SOA at a major corporation, &lt;em&gt;SOA in Practice&lt;/em&gt; explains how SOA can simplify the creation and maintenance of large-scale applications. Whether your project involves a large set of Web Services-based components, or connects legacy applications to modern business processes, this book clarifies how -- and whether -- SOA fits your needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
SOA has been a vision for years. This book brings it down to earth by describing the real-world problems of implementing and running a SOA in practice. After defining SOA's many facets, examining typical use patterns, and exploring how loose coupling helps build stronger applications, &lt;em&gt;SOA in Practice&lt;/em&gt; presents a framework to help you determine when to take advantage of SOA. In this book you will:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus squarely on real deployment and technology, not just standards maps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine business problems to determine which ones fit a SOA approach before plastering a SOA solution on top of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find clear paths for building solutions without getting trapped in the mire of changing web services details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain the experience of a systems analyst intimately involved with SOA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
"The principles and experiences described in this book played an important role in making SOA at T-Mobile a success story, with more than 10 million service calls per day."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Dr. Steffen Roehn, Member of the Executive Committee T-Mobile International (CIO)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Nicolai Josuttis has produced something that is rare in the over-hyped world of SOA; a thoughtful work with deep insights based on hands-on experiences. This book is a significant milestone in promoting practical disciplines for all SOA practitioners."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--John Schmidt, Chairman, Integration Consortium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"The book belongs in the hands of every CIO, IT Director and IT planning manager."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
--Dr. Richard Mark Soley, Chairman and CEO, Object Management Group; Executive Director, SOA Consortium&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is finally becoming a concrete discipline rather than a hopeful collection of cloud charts. This book demonstrates how SOA can simplify the creation of large-scale applications, whether your project involves a large set of Web Services-based components, or is a means to connect legacy applications to more modern business processes. &lt;em&gt;SOA in Practice&lt;/em&gt; explains how -- and whether -- SOA fits your needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to put Intuit's QuickBase to work? Our new Missing Manual shows you how to capture, modify, share, and manage data and documents with this web-based data-sharing program quickly and easily. No longer do you have to coordinate your team through a blizzard of emails or play frustrating games of "guess which document is the right one."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
QuickBase saves your organization time and money, letting you manage and share the information that makes your business tick: sales figures, project timelines, drafts of documents, purchase or work requests--whatever information you need to keep business flowing smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;QuickBase: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to choose among QuickBase's dozens of ready-made applications (mini-databases, essentially) and how to customize one to fit your needs exactly. You'll also learn to assign people different roles within the application. The guide also shows you how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Capture and modify data: Whatever kind of data you need to store--sales leads, catalog listings, project milestones, workflow checklists--you can use QuickBase's forms to record and organize that data so it makes sense to you.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter, sort, and group data: Easily find the records that match your criteria, and then sort those records into groups that make their relationships clear.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display your data: QuickBase uses different views (Table, Grid Edit, Summary/Crosstab, Calendar, Chart, and Timeline) to display and summarize data. Switching between them is easy, like taking tasks listed in a table and displaying them as a timeline.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create reports: Print out a hard copy, embed charts in the annual report, or email this month's sales numbers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Because Intuit frequently introduces new features to QuickBase, you'll find updates to this book at our Missing Manual web site so you can benefit from the latest technology and user suggestions right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a great deal of excitement surrounding the use of Linux in embedded systems -- for everything from cell phones to car ABS systems and water-filtration plants -- but not a lot of practical information. &lt;em&gt;Building Embedded Linux Systems&lt;/em&gt; offers an in-depth, hard-core guide to putting together embedded systems based on Linux. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Updated for the latest version of the Linux kernel, this new edition gives you the basics of building embedded Linux systems, along with the configuration, setup, and use of more than 40 different open source and free software packages in common use. The book also looks at the strengths and weaknesses of using Linux in an embedded system, plus a discussion of licensing issues, and an introduction to real-time, with a discussion of real-time options for Linux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This indispensable book features arcane and previously undocumented procedures for:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building your own GNU development toolchain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using an efficient embedded development framework&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selecting, configuring, building, and installing a target-specific kernel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a complete target root filesystem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up, manipulating, and using solid-state storage devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing and configuring a bootloader for the target&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-compiling a slew of utilities and packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging your embedded system using a plethora of tools and techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the uClibc, BusyBox, U-Boot, OpenSSH, thttpd, tftp, strace, and gdb packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
By presenting how to build the operating system components from pristine sources and how to find more documentation or help, &lt;em&gt;Building Embedded Linux Systems&lt;/em&gt; greatly simplifies the task of keeping complete control over your embedded operating system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Learning the vi and Vim Editors</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing that hard-core Unix and Linux users are more fanatical about than their text editor. Editors are the subject of adoration and worship, or of scorn and ridicule, depending upon whether the topic of discussion is your editor or someone else's. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; has been the standard editor for close to 30 years. Popular on Unix and Linux, it has a growing following on Windows systems, too. Most experienced system administrators cite &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; as their tool of choice. And since 1986, this book has been &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; guide for &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
However, Unix systems are not what they were 30 years ago, and neither is this book. While retaining all the valuable features of previous editions, the 7th edition of &lt;em&gt;Learning the vi and vim Editors&lt;/em&gt; has been expanded to include detailed information on &lt;em&gt;vim&lt;/em&gt;, the leading &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; clone. &lt;em&gt;vim&lt;/em&gt; is the default version of &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; on most Linux systems and on Mac OS X, and is available for many other operating systems too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With this guide, you learn text editing basics and advanced tools for both editors, such as multi-window editing, how to write both interactive macros and scripts to extend the editor, and power tools for programmers -- all in the easy-to-follow style that has made this book a classic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learning the vi and vim Editors&lt;/em&gt; includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;A complete introduction to text editing with vi:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to move around &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; in a hurry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beyond the basics, such as using buffers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;vi's&lt;/em&gt; global search and replacement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced editing, including customizing &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; and executing Unix commands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to make full use of vim:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extended text objects and more powerful regular expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-window editing and powerful &lt;em&gt;vim&lt;/em&gt; scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make full use of the GUI version of &lt;em&gt;vim&lt;/em&gt;, called &lt;em&gt;gvim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;vim's&lt;/em&gt; enhancements for programmers, such as syntax highlighting, folding and extended tags&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Coverage of three other popular &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; clones -- &lt;em&gt;nvi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;elvis&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;vile&lt;/em&gt; -- is also included. You'll find several valuable appendixes, including an alphabetical quick reference to both &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ex&lt;/em&gt; mode commands for regular &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; and for &lt;em&gt;vim&lt;/em&gt;, plus an updated appendix on &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; and the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Learning either &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;vim&lt;/em&gt; is required knowledge if you use Linux or Unix, and in either case, reading this book is essential.  After reading this book, the choice of editor will be obvious for you too.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The standard guide for &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; since 1986, this book has been expanded to include detailed information on &lt;em&gt;vim&lt;/em&gt;, the leading &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt; clone that includes extra features for both beginners and power users.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don't have to know everything about a car to drive one, and you don't need to know everything about Ruby to start programming with it. Written for both experienced and new programmers alike, &lt;em&gt;Learning Ruby&lt;/em&gt; is a just-get-in-and-drive book -- a hands-on tutorial that offers lots of Ruby programs and lets you know how and why they work, just enough to get you rolling down the road.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Interest in Ruby stems from the popularity of Rails, the web development framework that's attracting new devotees and refugees from Java and PHP. But there are plenty of other uses for this versatile language. The best way to learn is to just try the code! You'll find examples on nearly every page of this book that you can imitate and hack. Briefly, this book:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Outlines many of the most important features of Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrates how to use conditionals, and how to manipulate strings in Ruby. Includes a section on regular expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describes how to use operators, basic math, functions from the Math module, rational numbers, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talks you through Ruby arrays, and demonstrates hashes in detail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explains how to process files with Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discusses Ruby classes and modules (mixins) in detail, including a brief introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduces processing XML, the Tk toolkit, RubyGems, reflection, RDoc, embedded Ruby, metaprogramming, exception handling, and other topics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquaints you with some of the essentials of Rails, and includes a short Rails tutorial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Each chapter concludes with a set of review questions, and appendices provide you with a glossary of terms related to Ruby programming, plus reference material from the book in one convenient location. If you want to take Ruby out for a drive, &lt;em&gt;Learning Ruby&lt;/em&gt; holds the keys.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be passionate about photography, and own a digital SLR with perhaps more advanced equipment as well. But do the photographs you take with this powerful equipment come out as well as you'd like?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With this fascinating and beautifully illustrated book, you learn how to apply the techniques and principles of classic photography so you can make great images with today's digital equipment. Harold Davis, author and renowned fine art photographer, puts the focus in &lt;em&gt;Practical Artistry&lt;/em&gt; on light and exposure, two crucial concepts you need to understand and master if you are to truly capture the images you see.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Davis presents a generous number of his own images in each chapter, complete with technical information and an explanation of what he was trying to achieve. These striking photographs not only illustrate the lesson at hand, but also serve as inspiration for your own efforts. Browsing the photographs alone will tell you a lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Topics covered in this book include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camera, lenses, and equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding exposure and measuring light&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationship of aperture to shutter speed and ISO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with depth of field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural lighting, studio lighting, and the use of flash &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Light and color temperature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with white balance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photographing at dawn or dusk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photography at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capturing motion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telling a story with your image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capturing people, places, and things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up a digital workflow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RAW processing and double RAW processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjusting exposure and reducing noise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black &amp;amp; white photography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And much more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Concise and to the point, &lt;em&gt;Practical Artistry&lt;/em&gt; clearly demonstrates that photography, essentially, is writing with light, and that the type of images you produce depend on the many choices you have for using that skill. Harold Davis gives you an array of choices in full living color.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This beautifully illustrated book teaches you how to apply the techniques and principles of classic photography so you can make great images with today's digital equipment. With a focus on light and exposure, two crucial concepts you need to understand and master if you are to truly capture the images you see, author and renowned fine art photographer Harold Davis presents his own images as examples and inspiration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Written by members of the Apache Software Foundation, and thoroughly revised for Apache versions 2.0 and 2.2, recipes in this book range from simple tasks, such installing the server on Red Hat Linux or Windows, to more complex tasks, such as setting up name-based virtual hosts or securing and managing your proxy server. Altogether, you get more than 200 timesaving recipes for solving a crisis or other deadline conundrums, with topics including:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aliases, Redirecting, and Rewriting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CGI Scripts, the suexec Wrapper, and other dynamic content techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error Handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSL&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web 2.0 makes headlines, but how does it make money? This concise guide explains what's different about Web 2.0 and how those differences can improve your company's bottom line. Whether you're an executive plotting the next move, a small business owner looking to expand, or an entrepreneur planning a startup, &lt;em&gt;Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide&lt;/em&gt; illustrates through real-life examples how businesses, large and small, are creating new opportunities on today's Web.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book is about strategy. Rather than focus on the technology, the examples concentrate on its effect. You will learn that creating a Web 2.0 business, or integrating Web 2.0 strategies with your existing business, means creating places online where people like to come together to share what they think, see, and do. When people come together over the Web, the result can be much more than the sum of the parts. The customers themselves help build the site, as old-fashioned "word of mouth" becomes hypergrowth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates the power of this new paradigm by examining how: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flickr, a classic user-driven business, created value for itself by helping users create their own value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google made money with a model based on free search, and changed the rules for doing business on the Web-opening opportunities you can take advantage of&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social network effects can support a business-ever wonder how FaceBook grew so quickly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Businesses like Amazon tap into the Web as a source of indirect revenue, using creative new approaches to monetize the investments they've made in the Web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Written by Amy Shuen, an authority on Silicon Valley business models and innovation economics, &lt;em&gt;Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide&lt;/em&gt; explains how to transform your business by looking at specific practices for integrating Web 2.0 with what you do. If you're executing business strategy and want to know how the Web is changing business, this book is for you.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

App Engine is perhaps the most appealing web technology to appear in the last year, providing an easy-to-use application framework with basic web tools. While Google's own tutorial assumes significant experience, &lt;em&gt;Using Google App Engine&lt;/em&gt; will help anyone get started with this platform. By the end of this book, you'll know how to build complete, interactive applications and deploy them to the cloud using the same servers that power Google applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With this book, you will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get an overview of the technologies necessary to use Google App Engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to use Python, HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), HTTP, and DataStore, App Engine's database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grasp the technical aspects necessary to create sophisticated, dynamic web applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand what's required to deploy your applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Using Google App Engine&lt;/em&gt; is also an excellent resource for experienced programmers who want to acquire working knowledge of web technologies. Building web applications used to be for experts only, but with Google App Engine-and this book-anyone can create a dynamic web presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While termcap and terminfo are no longer as important as they once were, due to the growth of the X terminal market and increased standardization among ASCII terminals, handling different terminal types can still be a headache for system administrators. The termcap and terminfo databases are UNIX's solution to the difficulty of supporting many terminals without writing special drivers for each terminal. Termcap (BSD) and terminfo (System V) describe the features of hundreds of terminals, together with a library of routines that allow programs to use those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book documents hundreds of capabilities and syntax for termcap and terminfo, writing and debugging terminal descriptions, and terminal initialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contents include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Terminal independence: the need for termcap and terminfo.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading termcap and terminfo entries.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capability syntax.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;lint&lt;/i&gt; program checker has proven time and again to be one of the best tools for finding portability problems and certain types of coding errors in C programs. This book introduces you to &lt;i&gt;lint&lt;/i&gt;, guides you through running it on your programs, and helps you to interpret
&lt;i&gt;lint's&lt;/i&gt; output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;lint&lt;/i&gt; verifies a program or program segments against standard libraries, checks the code for common portability errors, and tests the programming against some tried and true guidelines. &lt;i&gt;linting&lt;/i&gt; your code is a necessary (though not sufficient) step in writing clean, portable, effective programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contents include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overview of using &lt;i&gt;lint&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with &lt;i&gt;lint'&lt;/i&gt; concerns:  casting and &lt;i&gt;delinting&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;lint&lt;/i&gt; comments
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;i&gt;lint&lt;/i&gt; in detail:  command line options, using &lt;i&gt;lint&lt;/i&gt;  with &lt;i&gt;make&lt;/i&gt;, rolling your own &lt;i&gt;lint&lt;/i&gt; library

    <title>POSIX Programmers Guide</title>

    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This guide, intended as an explanation of the POSIX standard and as a reference for the POSIX.1 programming library, helps you write more portable programs. Most UNIX systems today are POSIX compliant because the federal government requires it for its purchases. Even OSF and UI agree on support for POSIX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, given the manufacturer's documentation, it can be  difficult to distinguish system-specific features from those features  defined by POSIX. The &lt;i&gt;POSIX Programmer's Guide&lt;/i&gt; is especially  helpful if you are writing programs that must run on multiple UNIX  platforms. This guide also helps you convert existing UNIX programs for  POSIX compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contents include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction to POSIX.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basics of writing a POSIX-compliant program.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Input/output facilities of the Standard C library.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The file system as defined by POSIX.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operations of POSIX Input/Output system, pipes, and FIFOs.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating and terminating processes and signals.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obtaining information about the environment.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication line settings and a &lt;i&gt;cu&lt;/i&gt;-like utility.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;POSIX and Standard C, including features and portability pitfalls.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Internationalization.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complete list of library functions in alphabetic order.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complete list of data structures and their members.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All error codes.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Standard headers and the information that they define.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;RPC, or remote procedure calling, is the ability to distribute parts of a program to other computers on a network. An RPC facility manages the exchange of data between computers to make remote execution tranparent to the user. Distributed applications based on RPC can utilize distributed network resources and increase significantly the computing power brought to bear on complex problems. An RPC facility is the fundamental element of a distributed computing environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book builds a working understanding of RPC programming through examples. Sun RPC, the de facto standard on UNIX systems, is covered in detail. Interprocess communication and other related UNIX programming topics are also covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard-issue RPC documentation is difficult to understand and lacks real-world examples. There are, in addition, many techniques to learn. This book, written from a programmer's perspective, shows you what you can do with RPC and presents a framework for learning it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contents include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foundations of remote procedure calling; what it is, how it works,      and which vendors support it.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What RPC offers to application and product developers.
How RPC fits into a distributed computing environment.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ONC and DCE, a comparison of their similarities and differences.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to develop, debug, and deploy networked applications.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding the interprocess control (IPC) mechanisms on which RPC      is based.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using remote procedure calling in parallel/distributed processing and      scheduling.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using remote procedure calling with windowing systems.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examples of distributed applications using both single and multiple      concurrent servers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;RPC, or remote procedure calling, is the ability to distribute the execution of functions on remote computers. Written from a programmer's perspective, this book shows what you can do with RPCs, like Sun RPC, the de facto standard on UNIX systems. It covers related programming topics for Sun and other UNIX systems and teaches through examples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's "real-world programming"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-world programming (typically called real-time programming) is  programming that interacts in some way with the "real world" of daily  life.  At one time, real-time systems were confined to very esoteric  applications, like rocket guidance systems.  Now, they play a role in  almost every aspect of life: they control the brakes on your car, video  games, automatic bank tellers -- and the disk drive in your computer.   It won't be long before mundane devices like toasters and hair dryers  have microprocessors built in, to say nothing of multimedia devices that  haven't even been invented yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-world applications are characterized by deadlines.  If the brake processor in your car doesn't meet a deadline, your car doesn't stop; if your video game doesn't meet a deadline, the Klingons don't die when you shoot them; if your ATM doesn't meet a deadline, you may start looking for another bank.  When you've just rear-ended another car, it's no consolation that a sudden flurry of input slowed down your brake processor, so it couldn't react quickly enough when you hit the pedal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book covers the POSIX.4 standard for portable real-time programming.   The POSIX.4 standard itself is a massive document that defines system  interfaces for asynchronous I/O, scheduling, communications, and other  facilities.  However, this book does more than explain the standard.  It  provides a general introduction to real-time programming and real-time issues:  the problems software faces when it needs to interact with the real world  and how to solve them.  And, unlike most books about standards, this one  isn't just readable -- it's enjoyable!  If you're at all interested in  real-time applications -- which include just about everything from telemetry  to transaction processing -- this book will be an essential reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapters include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Basics of Real-Time:  Multiple Tasks
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Better Coordination:  Messages, Shared Memory, and Synchronization
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On Time:  Scheduling, Time, and Memory Locking
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I/O for the Real World
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes programming exercises, solutions, and reference manual pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A general introduction to real-time programming and real-time issues, this book covers the POSIX.4 standard and how to use it to solve "real-world" problems.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect is quickly becoming a part of every UNIX user's toolbox.  It allows you to automate Telnet, FTP, passwd, rlogin, and hundreds of other applications that normally require human interaction.  Using Expect to automate these applications will allow you to speed up tasks and, in many cases, solve new problems that you never would have even considered before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can use Expect to test interactive programs with no changes to their interfaces.  Or wrap interactive programs with Motif-like front-ends to control applications by buttons, scrollbars, and other graphic elements with no recompilation of the original programs.  You don't even need the source code!  Expect works with remote applications, too.  Use it to tie together Internet applications including Telnet, Archie, FTP, Gopher, and Mosaic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Libes is the creator of Expect as well as the author of this book. In &lt;i&gt;Exploring Expect&lt;/i&gt;, he provides a comprehensive tutorial on all of Expect's features, allowing you to put it immediately to work on your problems.  In a down-to-earth and humorous style, he provides numerous examples of challenging real-world applications and how they can be automated using Expect to save you time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expect is the first of a new breed of programs based on Tcl, the Tool Command Language that is rocking the computer science community.  This book provides an introduction to Tcl and describes how Expect applies Tcl's power to the new field of interaction automation.  Whether your interest is in Expect or interaction automation or you simply want to learn about Tcl and see how it has been used in real software, you will find &lt;i&gt;Exploring Expect&lt;/i&gt; a treasure trove of easy-to-understand and valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Written by the author of Expect, this is the first book to explain how this part of the UNIX toolbox can be used to automate Telnet, FTP, passwd, rlogin, and hundreds of other interactive applications. Based on Tcl (Tool Command Language), Expect lets you automate interactive applications that have previously been extremely difficult to handle with any scripting language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of the Internet is expanding beyond anyone's expectations. As corporations, government offices, and ordinary citizens begin to rely on the information highway to conduct business, they are realizing how important it is to protect their communications -- both to keep them a secret from prying eyes and to ensure that they are not altered during transmission.   Encryption, which until recently was an esoteric field of  interest only to spies, the military, and a few academics,  provides a mechanism for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PGP, which stands for Pretty Good Privacy, is a free and  widely available encryption program that lets you protect files and  electronic mail.  Written by Phil Zimmermann and released  in 1991, PGP works on virtually every platform and has become  very popular both in the U.S. and abroad.  Because it uses state-of-the-art public key cryptography, PGP can be used to authenticate messages, as well as keep them secret.  With PGP, you can digitally "sign" a message when you send it.  By checking the digital signature at the other end, the recipient can be sure that the message was not changed during transmission and that the message actually came from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PGP offers a popular alternative to U.S. government initiatives like the Clipper Chip because, unlike Clipper, it does not allow the  government or any other outside agency access to your secret keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;PGP: Pretty Good Privacy&lt;/i&gt; by Simson Garfinkel is both a readable technical user's guide and a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at cryptography and privacy.  Part I, "PGP Overview," introduces PGP and the cryptography that underlies it.  Part II, "Cryptography History and Policy," describes the history of PGP -- its personalities, legal battles, and other intrigues; it also provides background on the battles over public key cryptography patents and the U.S. government export restrictions, and other aspects of the ongoing public debates about privacy and free speech.  Part III, "Using PGP," describes how to use PGP:  protecting files and email, creating and using keys, signing messages, certifying and distributing keys, and using key servers. Part IV, "Appendices," describes how to obtain PGP from Internet sites, how to install it on PCs, UNIX systems, and the Macintosh, and other background information.  The book also contains a glossary, a bibliography, and a handy reference card that summarizes all of the PGP commands, environment variables, and configuration variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use UNIX, you know that it can be a technically challenging environment.  And if you're like most users, you have a job to do aside from exploring your operating system -- like analyzing that hot new stock, running another experiment, or typesetting another report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when you have problems?  What happens when the system slows to a crawl, when you can't get logged back in after a power failure, or when you've sent a file to the printer three times but have yet to find a printout?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first choice for handling a problem might be to have the  problem never occur.  Your second choice might be to have someone  else fix it, immediately.  However, in the real world, sometimes  you will have to investigate the problem and report it, and  sometimes you will have to find an answer yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When You Can't Find Your UNIX System Administrator&lt;/i&gt;, part of our new What You Need to Know series, gives UNIX users tools for  solving problems.  It offers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Practical solutions for problems you're likely to encounter  in logging in, running programs, sharing files, managing space resources, printing, and so on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Just enough background on what's going on "behind the scenes"  so that you can make sense of our suggestions, rather than simply memorizing keystrokes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; An explanation of how to present problems to your sys admin so that you're more likely to get quick, accurate support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A list of the site-specific information to which you should  have access, and a place to write it down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A quick-ref card summarizing what to try first, second, third for commonly encountered problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of this book is not to make you a guru in your own right.  The goal of this book is to get you back to the job you'd rather be doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is written for UNIX users, who are often cast adrift in a confusing environment. It provides the background and practical solutions you need to solve problems you're likely to encounter -- problems with logging in, printing, sharing files, running programs, managing space resources, etc. It also describes the kind of info to gather when you're asking for a diagnosis from a busy sys admin. And, it gives you a list of site-specific information that you should know, as well as a place to write it down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The promise of having control over their environment draws programmers to  UNIX.  It offers powerful tools for the initiated within an operating system  that can be customized and tuned in almost unlimited ways.  Programmers use UNIX because it lets them do what they want.  And they like to see the  source code for the software they work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's no surprise the most popular programming tools on UNIX are free.   They're easy to get, easy to customize, and better than many tools put  out by vendors.  They also offer a great deal of power.  And the source  code is publicly available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book and CD combination is a complete package for programmers who are new to UNIX or who would like to make better use of the system. The tools come from Cygnus Support, Inc., and Cyclic Software, companies that provide support for free software.  The tools on  the CD include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GNU Emacs, the legendary text editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;gcc&lt;/i&gt;, the C and C++ compiler that immediately established itself  as the best UNIX compiler for robustness and optimization
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GNU libraries (including C++ libraries)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;i&gt;gdb&lt;/i&gt; debugger
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RCS, a tool for backing up and maintaining multiple versions of  source files
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;GNU make, the most powerful version of that utility for managing builds
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book provides an introduction to all these tools for a C programmer.   Previous experience with UNIX is not required.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CD-ROM in this book contains binaries for several popular UNIX  systems, including Sun SPARC4 running SunOS 4.1.3, Sun SPARC4 running  Solaris 2.4, HP 9000/700 running HPUX, IBM RS/6000 running AIX 3,  SGI Iris/Indigo running Irix 5.3, and Alpha running Digital UNIX.   Complete source code and scripts for configuration, building, and  installation are also included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computers are just as busy as the rest of us nowadays.  They have lots of tasks to do at once, and need some cleverness to get them all done at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why threads are seen more and more often as a new model for programming.  Threads have been available for some time.  The Mach operating system, the Distributed Computer Environment (DCE), and Windows NT all feature threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One advantage of most UNIX implementations, as well as DCE, is that they conform to a recently ratified POSIX standard (originally 1003.4a, now 1003.1c), which allows your programs to be portable between them.  POSIX threads are commonly known as pthreads, after the word that starts all the names of the function calls.  The standard is supported by Solaris, OSF/1, AIX, and several other UNIX-based operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind threads programming is to have multiple tasks running concurrently within the same program.  They can share a single CPU as processes do, or take advantage of multiple CPUs when available.  In either case, they provide a clean way to divide the tasks of a program while sharing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A window interface can read input on dozens of different buttons, each responsible for a separate task.  A network server has to accept simultaneous calls from many clients, providing each with reasonable response time.  A multiprocessor runs a number-crunching program on several CPUs at once, combining the results when all are done.  All these kinds of applications can benefit from threads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book you will learn not only what the pthread calls are, but when it is a good idea to use threads and how to make them efficient (which is the whole reason for using threads in the first place).  The authors delves into performance issues, comparing threads to processes, contrasting kernel threads to user threads, and showing how to measure speed.  He also describes in a simple, clear manner what all the advanced features are for, and how threads interact with the rest of the UNIX system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic design techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mutexes, conditions, and specialized synchronization techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling, priorities, and other real-time issues
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancellation
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UNIX libraries and re-entrant routines
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signals
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging tips
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measuring performance
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Special considerations for the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;POSIX threads, or pthreads, allow multiple tasks to run concurrently within the same program. This book discusses when to use threads and how to make them efficient. It features realistic examples, a look behind the scenes at the implementation and performance issues, and special topics such as DCE and real-time extensions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>C++ The Core Language</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;C++ is an object-oriented enhancement of the C programming language  and is becoming the language of choice for serious software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C++ has crossed the Single Book Complexity Barrier.  The individual  features are not all that complex, but when put together in a program  they interact in highly non-intuitive ways.  Many books discuss each  of the features separately, giving readers the illusion that they  understand the language.  But when they try to program, they're in  for a painful surprise (even people who already know C).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C++: The Core Language&lt;/i&gt; is for C programmers transitioning to C++.   It's designed to get readers up to speed quickly by covering an essential  subset of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subset consists of features without which it's just not C++, and a  handful of others that make it a reasonably useful language.  You can  actually use this subset (using any compiler) to get familiar with  the basics of the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you really understand that much, it's time to do some programming and learn more from other books.  After reading this book, you'll be far better equipped to get something useful out of a reference manual, a graphical user interface programming book, and maybe a book on the specific libraries  you'll be using. (Take a look at our companion book, &lt;i&gt;Practical C++ Programming&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C++: The Core Language&lt;/i&gt; includes sidebars that give overviews of  all the advanced features not covered, so that readers know they exist  and how they fit in.  It covers features common to all C++ compilers,  including those on UNIX, Windows NT, Windows, DOS, and Macintosh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comparison&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;C++: The Core Language vs.
Practical C++ Programming&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly's policy is not to publish two books on the same topic for the same audience.  We'd rather spend twice the time on making one book the industry's best.  So why do we have two C++ tutorials?  Which one should you get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is they're very different.  Steve Oualline, author of the  successful book &lt;i&gt;Practical C Programming&lt;/i&gt;, came to us with the idea  of doing a C++ edition.  Thus was born &lt;i&gt;Practical C++ Programming&lt;/i&gt;.   It's a comprehensive tutorial to C++, starting from the ground up.  It also  covers the programming process, style, and other important real-world issues.   By providing exercises and problems with answers, the book helps you make sure  you understand before you move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that book was under development, we received the proposal for
&lt;i&gt;C++: The Core Language&lt;/i&gt;. Its innovative approach is to cover only a subset of the language -- the part that's most important to learn first -- and to assume readers already know C.  The idea is that C++ is just too complicated to learn all at once.  So, you learn the basics solidly from this short book, which prepares you to understand some of the 200+ other C++ books and to start programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two books are based on different philosophies and are for different  audiences.  But there is one way in which they work together. If you are  a C programmer, we recommend you start with &lt;i&gt;C++: The Core Language&lt;/i&gt;, then read about advanced topics and real-world problems in &lt;i&gt;Practical  C++ Programming&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A first book for C programmers transitioning to C++, an object-oriented enhancement of the C programming language. Designed to get readers up to speed quickly, this book thoroughly explains the important concepts and features and gives brief overviews of the rest of the language. Covers features common to all C++ compilers, including those on UNIX, Windows NT, Windows, DOS, and Macs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Applying RCS and SCCS&lt;/i&gt; tells you how to manage a complex software development project using RCS and SCCS.  The book tells you much more than how to use each command; it's organized in terms of increasingly complex management problems, from simple source management, to managing multiple releases, to coordinating teams of developers on a project involving many files and more than one target platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few developers use RCS or SCCS alone; most groups have written their own extensions for working with multiperson, multiplatform, multifile, multirelease projects.  Part of this book, therefore, discusses how to design your own tools on top of RCS or SCCS, both covering issues  related to "front-ending" in general, and by describing TCCS, one such  set of tools (available via FTP).  This book also provides an overview  of CVS, SPMS, and other project management environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Applying RCS and SCCS&lt;/i&gt; thoroughly introduces these two systems as tools for project management. It takes you through basic source control of a single file, working with multiple releases of a software project, and coordinating multiple developers. It also presents TCCS, a representative "front-end" that addresses problems RCS and SCCS can't handle alone, such as managing groups of files, developing for multiple platforms, and linking public and private development areas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use UNIX, you probably use &lt;i&gt;csh&lt;/i&gt; to type commands even if you've never heard of it.  It's the standard shell (command line) on most UNIX systems.  &lt;i&gt;tcsh&lt;/i&gt; is an enhanced version that's freely available and  highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Using csh &amp;amp; tcsh&lt;/i&gt; describes from the beginning how to use these shells interactively.  More important, it shows how to get your work done faster with less typing.  Even if you've used UNIX for years,  techniques described in this book can make you more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll learn how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make your prompt tell you where you are (no more pwd)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use what you've typed before (history)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type long command lines with very few keystrokes (command and     filename completion)
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remind yourself of filenames when in the middle of typing a     command
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit a botched command instead of retyping it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book does not cover programming or script writing in &lt;i&gt;csh&lt;/i&gt; or
&lt;i&gt;tcsh&lt;/i&gt; because the tasks are better done with a different shell,  such as &lt;i&gt;sh&lt;/i&gt; (the Bourne shell) or a language like Perl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distributed computing and Java go together naturally. As the first language designed from the bottom up with networking in mind, Java makes it very easy for computers to cooperate. Even the simplest applet running in a browser is a distributed application, if you think about it. The client running the browser downloads and executes code that is delivered by some other system. But even this simple applet wouldn't be possible without Java's guarantees of portability and security: the applet can run on any platform, and can't sabotage its host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, when we think of distributed computing, we usually think of applications more complex than a client and server communicating with the same protocol. We usually think in terms of programs that make remote procedure calls, access remote databases, and collaborate with others to produce a single result. &lt;i&gt;Java Distributed Computing&lt;/i&gt; discusses how to design and write such applications. It covers Java's RMI (Remote Method Invocation) facility and CORBA, but it doesn't stop there; it tells you how to design your own protocols to build message passing systems and discusses how to use Java's security facilities, how to write multithreaded servers, and more. It pays special attention to distributed data systems, collaboration, and applications that have high bandwidth requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, distributed computing can only become more important.
&lt;i&gt;Java Distributed Computing&lt;/i&gt; provides a broad introduction to the problems you'll face and the solutions you'll find as you write distributed computing applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered in &lt;i&gt;Java Distributed Computing&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Distributed Computing&lt;/i&gt; offers a general introduction to distributed computing, meaning programs that run on two or more systems. It focuses primarily on how to structure and write distributed applications and discusses issues like designing protocols, security, working with databases, and dealing with low bandwidth situations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;sed &amp;amp; awk&lt;/i&gt; describes two text processing programs that are mainstays of the UNIX programmer's toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;sed&lt;/i&gt; is a "stream editor" for editing streams of text that might be too large to edit as a single file, or that might be generated on the fly as part of a larger data processing step. The most common operation done with &lt;i&gt;sed&lt;/i&gt; is substitution, replacing one block of text with another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; is a complete programming language. Unlike many conventional  languages, &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; is "data driven" -- you specify what kind of data you  are interested in and the operations to be performed when that data is  found. &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; does many things for you, including automatically  opening and closing data files, reading records, breaking the records up  into fields, and counting the records. While &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; provides the  features of most conventional programming languages, it also includes some  unconventional features, such as extended regular expression matching and  associative arrays. &lt;i&gt;sed &amp;amp; awk&lt;/i&gt; describes both programs in detail  and includes a chapter of example &lt;i&gt;sed&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This edition covers features of &lt;i&gt;sed&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; that are  mandated by the POSIX standard. This most notably affects &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt;, where  POSIX standardized a new variable, CONVFMT, and new functions, &lt;i&gt;toupper&lt;/i&gt;()  and &lt;i&gt;tolower&lt;/i&gt;(). The CONVFMT variable specifies the conversion format  to use when converting numbers to strings (&lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; used to use OFMT for this  purpose). The &lt;i&gt;toupper&lt;/i&gt;() and &lt;i&gt;tolower&lt;/i&gt;() functions each take a  (presumably mixed case) string argument and return a new version of the  string with all letters translated to the corresponding case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, this edition covers GNU &lt;i&gt;sed&lt;/i&gt;, newly available since the first edition. It also updates the first edition coverage of Bell Labs &lt;i&gt;nawk&lt;/i&gt;  and GNU &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;gawk&lt;/i&gt;), covers &lt;i&gt;mawk&lt;/i&gt;, an additional freely  available implementation of &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt;, and briefly discusses three commercial versions of &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt;, MKS &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt;, Thompson Automation &lt;i&gt;awk&lt;/i&gt;  (&lt;i&gt;tawk&lt;/i&gt;), and Videosoft (VSAwk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;imake&lt;/i&gt; is a utility that works with &lt;i&gt;imake&lt;/i&gt; to enable code  to be compiled and installed on different UNIX machines.  &lt;i&gt;imake&lt;/i&gt; makes possible the wide portability of the X Window System code and  is widely considered an X tool, but it's also useful for any software  project that needs to be ported to many UNIX systems.  &lt;i&gt;imake&lt;/i&gt; also runs under Windows NT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This handbook is ideal for X and UNIX programmers who want their software  to be portable. The book is divided into two sections.  The first section  is a general explanation of &lt;i&gt;imake&lt;/i&gt;, X configuration files, and how  to write and debug an &lt;i&gt;Imakefile&lt;/i&gt;.  The second section describes how  to write configuration files and presents a configuration file architecture  that allows development of coexisting sets of configuration files.  Several  sample sets of configuration files are described and are available free  over the Net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New in the second edition:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updated to cover the version X11R6.1 of the X Window System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discusses using &lt;i&gt;imake&lt;/i&gt; for non-UNIX systems such as Windows NT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covers some of the quirks about using &lt;i&gt;imake&lt;/i&gt; under OpenWindows/Solaris&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The books in O'Reilly's Oracle series are authoritative -- they tell the  whole story about complex topics, ranging from performance tuning to the  use of packages in PL/SQL to new technologies like Power Objects. And  they're independent; they're alternatives for readers who need to know  how products and features really work. They're packed with real-world  advice and techniques from practitioners in the field, and they come with  disks containing code you can use immediately in your own applications.   O'Reilly is the alternative for Oracle people who need to solve problems --  and solve them now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance tuning is crucial in any modern relational database management system. Too many organizations respond to Oracle performance problems by throwing money at these problems -- by buying larger and more expensive computers or by hiring expert consultants. But there's a lot you can do on your own to increase dramatically the performance of your existing system. Whatever version of Oracle you're running -- from Version 6 to Oracle8, proper tuning can save your organization a huge amount of money  in additional equipment, extra memory, and hardware upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first edition of &lt;i&gt;Oracle Performance Tuning&lt;/i&gt; became a classic for programmers, managers, database administrators, system  administrators, and anyone who cares about improving the performance of  an Oracle system. This second edition contains 400 pages of updated material updating on Oracle features, incorporating advice about  disk striping and mirroring, RAID, client-server, distributed  databases, MPPS, SMPs, and other architectures. It also includes  chapters on parallel server, parallel query, backup and recovery,  the Oracle Performance Pack, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Learning VBScript</title>
    <author>Paul Lomax</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the advent of client-side scripting, it is possible to create programs that run on a user's browser in response to particular user actions, like  passing the mouse over a hyperlink or clicking a standard HTML command button.  By taking advantage of client-side scripts, web pages can be made  more interactive, and programs that ran as (usually CGI) applications on the server before client-side scripting can now execute on the browser, in the process improving the performance of a web site's web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Learning VBScript&lt;/i&gt;, Paul Lomax shows how to take full advantage of  client-side scripting using Microsoft's own scripting language, Visual Basic  Scripting Edition, or VBScript.  &lt;i&gt;Learning VBScript&lt;/i&gt; consists of three  distinct sections that quickly teach the reader how take advantage of  client-side scripting to enhance a web site's pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A fast-paced introduction to VBScript that covers the basic features  of the language and their syntax.  Although these tutorial chapters are  written primarily for web content providers, they also explore the difference  between VBScript and Visual Basic for Applications, the programming language  used both in Visual Basic and in the individual components of Microsoft Office,  making them of interest to the millions of VBA programmers who are fairly  new to the Web and to developing web pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to the Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) object model.   By accessing the events, properties, and methods exposed by the browser's  object model, VBScript is transformed from a fairly powerless programming  language into a powerful development tool that can be used to control the  browser, allowing the creation of complex interactive web pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A series of chapters, each of which examines a set of techniques  that use client-side scripting to enhance the interactivity and  attractiveness of a web site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In focusing on techniques for creating professional, scripted web pages,
&lt;i&gt;Learning VBScript&lt;/i&gt; includes chapters on the following:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating documents "on the fly" from a script running on the browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully describing hyperlinks when the user's mouse passes over them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performing validation on data entered by the user &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; it  is submitted to the server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporating ActiveX controls in a web page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;gt;Using VBScript's error handling feature to anticipate and handle  user errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handling different browsers, particularly MSIE, Netscape Navigator,  and the older browsers that don't support scripting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CD-ROM accompanying &lt;i&gt;Learning VBScript&lt;/i&gt; includes over 170 code  samples, and allows you to retrieve examples by category;  you can, for  instance, retrieve hyperlinks to all the web pages that include ActiveX  controls.  In addition, the CD-ROM includes a complete shopping cart  application that can be easily customized for your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a content provider who wants to add client-side scripts  to web pages or a Visual Basic programmer who wants to begin creating web  applications, &lt;i&gt;Learning VBScript&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive guide that takes  you through the rudiments of the language and covers the techniques  needed to develop professional web pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This definitive guide shows web developers how to take full advantage of client-side scripting with the VBScript language. In addition to basic language features, it covers the Internet Explorer object model and discusses techniques for client-side scripting, like adding ActiveX controls to a web page or validating data before sending it to the server. Includes CD-ROM with over 170 code samples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Managing Mailing Lists</title>
    <author>Alan Schwartz</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you like to set up an electronic discussion forum for your customers? Or how about a mailing list to announce meetings of your local hobby group? Email is the universal Internet application, which makes mailing lists an ideal vehicle for creating electronic communities. All you need to run a mailing list is access to a system that is connected to the Internet, a mailing list management software package, and a bit of know-how, which is where this book comes in.
&lt;i&gt;Managing Mailing Lists&lt;/i&gt; is full of practical information for the list maintainer and system administrator alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book covers four mailing list packages: Majordomo, LISTSERV, Listproc, and SmartList. All of these packages run on UNIX systems; LISTSERV runs on a number of platforms, including Windows NT. If you are a system administrator, &lt;i&gt;Managing Mailing Lists&lt;/i&gt; tells you what you need to know to pick a mailing list package and get it up and running on your system. It also offers advice on working with the people who are actually maintaining mailing lists on your system, so that you can give them the support they need to run effective, useful lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are charged with establishing and running a mailing list,
&lt;i&gt;Managing Mailing Lists&lt;/i&gt; covers everything you need to know about setting up and maintaining the list, from writing the charter for the list to dealing with bounced messages. Depending on what mailing list software is running on your system, you'll need to work with your system administrator to set up various aspects of the list. This book lays out all the decisions you need to make and tells you what information you need to pass along to the administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mailing lists offer a great deal of flexibility. For example, you can create a moderated mailing list, so that you can control the content on the list, or you can let anyone post whatever they want, for a more free-form discussion group. You can also exert control over who can subscribe to the list, if you want to limit membership based on certain criteria. You can give your subscribers the option to receive individual messages or message digests and you can archive list postings and make them available to your readership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oracle Design&lt;/i&gt; looks thoroughly at the field of Oracle relational database  design.  The design of both databases and applications is an often neglected area of Oracle, but one that has an enormous impact on the ultimate power  and performance of a system.  If the initial design is poor, then the most  powerful hardware, the most sophisticated software tools, and the most highly tuned data and programs won't make your system run smoothly and efficiently.   Indeed, applications that have been designed poorly will never be able to perform well, regardless of the tuning and retrofitting performed later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three main areas of Oracle design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The design of the specific database objects (e.g., tables, views, indexes,  stored functions) that will be implemented in a database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The design of the screens, reports, and programs that will maintain the  data and allow inquiries against it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Under certain circumstances, the design must also be concerned with the  specific environment or technology (e.g., the network topology, the hardware  configuration, and the use of a client/server, parallel processing, or  distributed database architecture).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book examines all aspects of database and code design. Part I examines the project life cycle and where design fits in that cycle; it shows a sample case  study, identifies the areas of Oracle7 that are of particular interest to  designers, takes a look ahead at Oracle8, and provides an in-depth discussion  of data modeling (e.g., entities, relationships, attributes, entity models, function hierarchies).  Part II describes design issues for the database itself -- denormalization, data types, keys, indexes, temporal data, import/export,  backup, recovery, security, and more. Part III explores design issues for specific architectures and environments -- client/server, distributed database, data warehouses, and parallel processing. Part IV describes design issues for  the code that accesses the database -- metrics and prototypes, locking, the  toolset, design of screens, reports, batch programs, etc.  Part V contains  summary appendixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table of contents follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part I: Getting Started with Design
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;1.  Introduction &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;2.  Why is Design so Important for Oracle? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;3.  Data Modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Part II: Designing the Database
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;4.  Deciding When to Denormalize &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;5.  Choosing Data Types and NULLs &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;6.  Choosing Keys and Indexes &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;7.  Dealing with Temporal Data &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;8.  Loading and Unloading Data &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;9.  Deciding on Object Placement and Storage&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li type="disc"&gt;10. Safeguarding Your Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Part III: Designing for Specific Architectures
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;11. Designing for Client/Server&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li type="disc"&gt;12. Designing Distributed Databases &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;13. Designing for Data Warehouse&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li type="disc"&gt;14. Designing for Parallel Processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part IV: Designing the Code Modules
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;15. Introduction to Code Design &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;16. Determining Where to Locate the Processing &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;17. Metrics, Prototypes, and Specifications&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li type="disc"&gt;18. Locking &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;19. Selecting the Toolset &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;20. Designing Screens, Reports, Batch Programs, Error     Handling, and Help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Part V: Appendixes
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;A.  Off-the-Shelf Packages &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;B.  Tricks of the Trade&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book looks thoroughly at the field of Oracle relational database design, an often neglected area of Oracle, but one that has an enormous impact on the ultimate power and performance of a system.

&lt;p&gt;sendmail is the program that acts like a traffic cop in routing and delivering mail on UNIX-based networks -- it is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA),  accepting mail from Mail User Agents (MUAs), mail users (humans), and other  MTAs.  Then, it delivers that mail to Mail Delivery Agents (MDAs) on the local  machine, or transports that mail to another MTA on another machine.  Although  sendmail is used on almost every UNIX system, it's one of the last great  uncharted territories -- and most difficult utilities to learn -- in UNIX  system administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed as a companion volume to &lt;i&gt;sendmail, 2nd Edition&lt;/i&gt;, this guide  covers the latest version (V8.8) from the University of California, Berkeley,  and has extensive cross-references to sections in the main volume.  Both books  are coauthored by Eric Allman, the creator of sendmail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java Beans is the most important new development in Java this year.  Beans is the next generation of Java technology that not only adds features the language lacked, but also lets Java programs interoperate with a number of development environments.  The initial release includes a bridge for Microsoft's ActiveX/COM; future releases will include bridges for Netscape's LiveConnect and IBM's OpenDoc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it's a "component architecture" for Java, Beans can be used in graphical programming environments, like Borland's JBuilder, or IBM's VisualAge for Java.  This means that someone can use a graphical tool to connect a lot of Beans together and make an application, without actually writing any Java code -- in fact, without doing any programming at all. Graphical development environments let you configure components by specifying aspects of their visual appearance (like the color or label of a button) in addition to the interactions between components (what happens when you click on a button or select a menu item).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important aspect of Java Beans is that components don't have to be visible.  This sounds like a minor distinction, but it's very important: the invisible parts of an application are the parts that do the work.  So, for example, in addition to manipulating graphical widgets, like checkboxes and menus, Beans allows you to develop and manipulate components that do database access, perform computations, and so on. You can build entire applications by connecting pre-built components, without writing any code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Developing Java Beans&lt;/i&gt; is for people who need to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in programming technology.  Minimally, developing Beans means adopting several simple design patterns in your code.  However, that's only the beginning.  To take full advantage of the Java Beans architecture, you should understand how to write classes that are serializable, use events for communication between classes, know when and how to provide BeanInfo classes that give graphical environments more information about your components, and provide property editors and  customizers that let graphical tools work with more complex Beans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Events, event listeners, and adapters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properties, indexed properties, bound properties, constrained properties, and vetoable property changes &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistence, serialization, versioning, and object validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packaging Beans using JAR files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The BeanBox, a prototypical development tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflection and introspection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Property editors and customizers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ActiveX bridge; using Java Beans in Visual Basic programs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of introductory C books, but this is the first one that has the no-nonsense, practical approach that has made Nutshell Handbooks&amp;#174; famous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C programming is more than just getting the syntax right. Style and debugging also play a tremendous part in creating programs that run well and are easy to maintain. This book teaches you not only the mechanics of programming, but also describes how to create programs that are easy to read, debug, and update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical rules are stressed. For example, there are fifteen precedence rules in C (&amp;amp;&amp;amp; comes before || comes before ?:). The practical programmer reduces these to two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, most programmers do not spend most of their time creating code. Most of their time is spent modifying someone else's  code.  This books shows you how to avoid the all-too-common obfuscated uses  of C (and also to recognize these uses when you encounter them in existing programs) and thereby to leave code that the programmer responsible for maintenance does not have to struggle with. Electronic Archaeology, the art  of going through someone else's code, is described. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This third edition introduces popular Integrated Development Environments  on Windows systems, as well as UNIX programming utilities, and features a large statistics-generating program to pull together the concepts and  features in the language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routers are the glue that connects the pieces of your network.  Even in the simplest networks, this isn't a simple task.  Routers have evolved into highly specialized computing platforms, with extremely flexible but complex capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Managing IP Networks with Cisco Routers&lt;/i&gt; is a practical guide to setting up and maintaining a production network.  It discusses issues like how to select routing protocols and how to configure protocols to handle most common situations.  It also discusses less esoteric but equally important issues like how to evaluate network equipment and vendors and how to set up a help desk.  Although the book focuses on Cisco routers, and gives examples using Cisco's IOS, the principles discussed are common to all IP networks, regardless of the vendor you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is firmly grounded in the realities of day-to-day network management.  It's designed to solve real-world problems, like: "How do I prevent my router from using unreliable information from other routers?" "How do I safeguard my router against attacks?" "How can I make my network more reliable?"  If you're building or maintaining an IP network, you'll find this book indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designing an IP network
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Evaluating equipment and vendors
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selecting routing protocols
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configuring common interior protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connecting to external networks and configuring exterior protocols (BGP)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ongoing network management: troubleshooting and maintenance
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security and privacy issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This practical guide to setting up and maintaining a production network covers how to select routing protocols, configure protocols to handle most common situations, evaluate network equipment and vendors, and set up a help desk.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, the Internet has grown from a network that connected a few universities and research centers to a network that links many businesses and households all over the country. That expansion occurred for many reasons, but the technological advance that facilitated this growth was an obscure protocol called PPP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPP isn't talked about as much as TCP and IP, but it plays a crucial role in extending networks into remote locations. The Point-to-Point Protocol enables telephone lines and other point-to-point connections to carry Internet traffic. It's the protocol that establishes and maintains the connection between your home and an Internet service provider. This book provides in-depth coverage of PPP for network administrators and others who are involved in the care and maintenance of PPP connections. It provides a thorough introduction to how PPP works, which will help you diagnose and troubleshoot problems. It discusses in detail how to set up dial-in and dial-out PPP on the most important platforms, including Windows, Linux, and Solaris. Whether you're a sophisticated user responsible for your own connection or a network administrator providing dial-up services for hundreds of remote users, you'll find this book an essential addition to your library. Covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PPP implementations in Windows 95/98/NT, Solaris, and Linux
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Authentication (CHAP, PAP, Microsoft variants, and other techniques)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Virtual networks and tunnels, including PPTP
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Modems and serial lines
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Related technologies, including DNS and ARP
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimizing and customizing a connection
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debugging techniques&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is for network administrators and others who have to set up computer systems to use PPP. It covers all aspects of the protocol, including how to set up dial-in servers, authentication, debugging, and PPP options. In addition, it contains overviews of related areas, like serial communications, DNS setup, and routing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>VB &amp; VBA in a Nutshell: The Language</title>
    <author>Paul Lomax</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online documentation of VB/VBA language components seems to follow the 80/20 rule: the basic facts that you need to use a language statement are  provided in the documentation. But the additional 20 percent that you need  to use it effectively or to apply it to special cases is conspicuously absent.  To a professional VB/VBA programmer, though, this missing 20 percent of the  language's documentation isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. And in
&lt;i&gt;VB &amp;amp; VBA in a Nutshell: The Language&lt;/i&gt;, it finally is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the book consists of an alphabetical reference to the  statements, procedures, and functions of the VB/VBA language. Each entry has a standardized listing containing the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its syntax, using standard code conventions
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Differences in the operation of the keyword in a macro environment  (e.g., in Office) and in Visual Basic, if there are any&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A list of arguments accepted by the function or procedure, if any&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A description of the data type returned by a function
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The finer points of a keyword's usage that are often omitted from  or blurred over by the documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tips and gotchas that include undocumented behaviors and practical applications for particular language elements -- a section particularly  invaluable for diagnosing or avoiding potential programming problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief, nonobvious example that illustrates the use of the keyword&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also included in &lt;i&gt;VB &amp;amp; VBA in a Nutshell: The Language&lt;/i&gt; is a brief  overview of the VB/VBA language, including:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Basic VBA programming concepts, such as its data types and its support for variables, constants, and arrays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error handling in VBA applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object programming with VBA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using VBA with particular applications. Excel and Project are utilized to show how to work with an application's integrated development environment  and to take advantage of its object model   Regardless of how much experience you have programming with VBA, this is the book you'll pick up time and time again both as your standard reference  guide and as a tool for troubleshooting and identifying programming problems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;VB &amp;amp; VBA in a Nutshell: The Language&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive reference for  Visual Basic and VBA developers.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;For Visual Basic and VBA programmers, this book boils down the essentials of the VB and VBA languages into a single volume, including undocumented and little-documented areas essential to everyday programming. The convenient alphabetical reference to all functions, procedures, statements, and keywords allows programmers to use this book both as a standard reference guide and as a tool for troubleshooting and identifying programming problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the Web. Using JavaScript, you can create dynamic, interactive web pages that include image rollovers, pop-up windows, auto-scrolling frames, intelligent forms, and sophisticated Dynamic HTML effects. Even better, you don't have to be a programming ace to learn enough JavaScript to incorporate these elements into your web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Designing with JavaScript&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to create the effects you want, without forcing you to wade through pages of dry programmer-speak about variables, operators, and functions. Each chapter demonstrates common JavaScript techniques and explains how to customize them for your own use. Along the way, it introduces basic JavaScript concepts, teaching the language in the context of real-world examples. By the time you finish this book, you'll have a solid foundation of JavaScript knowledge that you can apply to your own web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Designing with JavaScript&lt;/i&gt;, you will learn to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Use JavaScript to produce visual effects, such as image rollovers and rotating billboards
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Launch new browser windows, control frames, and validate form data
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Customize your site by using JavaScript to detect browsers, platforms, and plug-ins
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Use cookies to keep track of visitors, so you can welcome new users while offering customized pages to returning users
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Create a tabbed folder interface, drop-down menus, and a scrolling headline ticker, using the basics of Dynamic HTML
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first edition of &lt;i&gt;Designing with JavaScript&lt;/i&gt; taught tens of thousands of web designers how to enliven their pages with JavaScript. This new edition has been updated to cover the latest JavaScript techniques supported by current web browsers.  If you are ready to start incorporating JavaScript into your designs, this is the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The second edition of &lt;i&gt;Designing with JavaScript&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to create dynamic, interactive web pages, using image rollovers, pop-up windows, auto-scrolling frames, intelligent forms, and sophisticated Dynamic HTML effects.

    <title>Oracle Built-in Packages</title>
    <author>Steven Feuerstein, Charles Dye, John Beresniewicz</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle is the most popular database management system in use today, and  PL/SQL plays a pivotal role in current and projected Oracle products and  applications. PL/SQL is a programming language providing procedural  extensions to the SQL relational database language and to an ever-growing  number of oracle development tools. originally a rather limited tool,  PL/SQL became with Oracle7 a mature and effective language for developers. now, with the introduction of Oracle8, PL/SQL has taken the next step  towards becoming a fully realized programming language providing  sophisticated object-oriented capabilities. Steven Feuerstein's
&lt;i&gt;Oracle PL/SQL Programming&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive guide to building  applications with PL/SQL. That book has become the bible for PL/SQL  developers who have raved about its completeness, readability, and  practicality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Built-in packages are collections of PL/SQL objects built by Oracle Corporation and stored directly in the Oracle database. The functionality of these packages is available from any programming environment that can call PL/SQL stored procedures, including Visual Basic, Oracle Developer/2000, Oracle Application Server (for web-based development), and, of course, the Oracle database itself. Built-in packages extend the capabilities and power of PL/SQL in many significant ways. for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;DBMS_SQL executes dynamically constructed SQL statements and PL/SQL blocks of code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;DBMS_PIPE communicates between different Oracle sessions through a pipe in the RDBMS shared memory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;DBMS_JOB submits and manages regularly scheduled jobs for execution inside the database. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;DBMS_LOB accesses and manipulates Oracle8's large objects (LOBs) from within PL/SQL programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first edition of &lt;i&gt;Oracle PL/SQL Programming&lt;/i&gt; contained a chapter on  Oracle's built-in packages. but there is much more to say about the basic  PL/SQL packages than Feuerstein could fit in his first book. In addition,  now that Oracle8 has been released, there are many new Oracle8 built-in  packages not described in the PL/SQL book. There are also packages extensions  for specific oracle environments such as distributed database. hence this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oracle Built-in Packages&lt;/i&gt; pulls together information about how to use the  calling interface (API) to Oracle's Built-in Packages, and provides extensive examples on using the built-in packages effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The windows diskette included with the book contains the companion guide, an online tool developed by RevealNet, Inc., that provides  point-and-click access to the many files of source code and online  documentation developed by the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The table of contents follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preface&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part I: Overview&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part II: Application Development Packages
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt; Executing Dynamic SQL and PL/SQL &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt; Intersession Communication  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt; User Lock and Transaction Management  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt; Oracle Advanced Queuing  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt; Generating Output from PL/SQL Programs  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt; Defining an Application Profile &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt; Managing Large Objects &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt; Datatype Packages &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt; Miscellaneous Packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Part III: Server Management Packages
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Managing Session Information &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Managing Server Resources &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Job Scheduling in the Database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part IV: Distributed Database Packages
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Snapshots &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Advanced Replication &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Conflict Resolution &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Deferred Transactions and Remote Procedure Calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Appendix. What's on the companion disk?&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Oracle's built-in packages dramatically extend the power of the PL/SQL language, but few developers know how to use them effectively. This book is a complete reference to all of the built-ins, including those new to Oracle8. the enclosed diskette includes an online tool that provides easy access to the many files of source code and documentation developed by the authors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco routers are used widely both on the Internet and in corporate  intranets.  At the same time, the Cisco Internet Operating System (IOS)  has grown to be very large and complex, and Cisco documentation fills  several volumes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cisco IOS Access Lists&lt;/i&gt; focuses on a critical aspect of the  Cisco IOS--access lists. Access lists are central to the task of  securing routers and networks, and administrators cannot implement  access control policies or traffic routing policies without them. Access  lists are used to specify both the targets of network policies and the  policies themselves. They specify packet filtering for firewalls all  over the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cisco IOS Access Lists&lt;/i&gt; covers three critical areas: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Intranets.&lt;/b&gt; The book serves as an introduction and a reference  for network engineers implementing routing policies within intranet  networking.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Firewalls.&lt;/b&gt; The book is a supplement and companion reference to  books such as Brent Chapman's &lt;i&gt;Building Internet Firewalls.&lt;/i&gt;   Packet filtering is an integral part of many firewall architectures, and
&lt;i&gt;Cisco IOS Access Lists &lt;/i&gt;describes common packet filtering tasks  and provides a "bag of tricks" for firewall implementers.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Internet.&lt;/b&gt; This book is also a guide to the complicated world  of route maps. Route maps are an arcane BGP construct necessary to make  high level routing work on the Internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cisco IOS Access Lists&lt;/i&gt; differs from other Cisco router  titles in that it focuses on practical instructions for setting router  access policies. The details of interfaces and routing protocol settings  are not discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book focuses on a critical aspect of the Cisco IOS--access lists, which are central to securing routers and networks. Administrators cannot implement access control or traffic routing policies without them. The book covers intranets, firewalls, and the Internet. Unlike other Cisco router titles, it focuses on practical instructions for setting router access policies rather than the details of interfaces and routing protocol settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many programmers would love to use Perl for projects that involve heavy  lifting, but miss the many traditional algorithms that textbooks teach  for other languages. Computer scientists have identified many techniques that a wide range of programs need, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fuzzy pattern matching for text (identify misspellings!)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finding correlations in data
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Game-playing algorithms
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Predicting phenomena such as Web traffic
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polynomial and spline fitting

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using algorithms explained in this book, you too can carry out traditional programming tasks in a high-powered, efficient, easy-to-maintain manner with Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book assumes a basic understanding of Perl syntax and functions,  but not necessarily any background in computer science. The authors explain in a readable fashion the reasons for using various classic programming techniques, the kind of applications that use them, and -- most  important -- how to code these algorithms in Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an amateur programmer, this book will fill you in on the  essential algorithms you need to solve problems like an expert. If you have already learned algorithms in other languages, you will be  surprised at how much different (and often easier) it is to implement them  in Perl. And yes, the book even has the obligatory fractal display program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been dozens of books on programming algorithms, some of them excellent, but never before has there been one that uses Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The authors include the editor of &lt;i&gt;The Perl Journal&lt;/i&gt; and master  librarian of CPAN; all are contributors to CPAN and have archived much of the code in this book there.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This book was so exciting I lost sleep reading it." Tom Christiansen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;There have been dozens of books on programming algorithms, but never before has there been one that uses Perl. Whether you are an amateur programmer or know a wide range of algorithms in other languages, this book will teach you how to carry out traditional programming tasks in a high-powered, efficient, easy-to-maintain manner with Perl. Topics range in complexity from sorting and searching to statistical algorithms, numerical analysis, and encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transact-SQL is a procedural language used on both Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase SQL Server systems. It is a full-featured programming language that dramatically extends the power of SQL (Structured Query  Language). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language provides programmers with a broad range of features, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rich set of datatypes, including specialized types for identifiers, timestamps, images, and long text fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local and global variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully programmable server objects like views, triggers, stored procedures, and batch command files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conditional processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exception and error handling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full transaction control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System stored procedures that reduce the complexity of many operations, like adding users or automatically generating HTML Web pages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the versions of Transact-SQL have diverged on Microsoft and Sybase systems; the book explains the differences. It also contains up-to-the-minute information on the latest versions: Microsoft SQL Server versions 6.5 and  7.0 and Sybase version 11.5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief table of contents follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PART I: The Basics: Programming in Transact-SQL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Transact-SQL &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matching Business Rules &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL Primer &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transact-SQL Fundamentals &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Format and Style&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;PART II: The Building Blocks: Transact-SQL Language Elements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Datatypes and Variables &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conditional Processing &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Row Processing with Cursors &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error Handling &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temporary Objects &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transactions and Logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;PART III: Functions and Extensions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Functions &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CASE Expressions and Transact-SQL Extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;PART IV: Programming Transact-SQL Objects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stored Procedures and Modular Design &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triggers &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Views &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System and Extended Stored Procedures and BCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;PART V: Performance Tuning and Optimization&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Transact-SQL Code Design &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code Maintenance in the SQL Server &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transact-SQL Optimization and Tuning &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debugging Transact-SQL Programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;PART VI: Appendixes&lt;/p&gt;

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryptography, the science of secret writing, is the biggest, baddest security tool in the application programmer's arsenal. Cryptography provides three services that are crucial in secure programming. These include a cryptographic cipher that protects the secrecy of your data; cryptographic certificates, which prove identity (authentication);  and digital signatures, which ensure your data has not been damaged  or tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book covers cryptographic programming in Java. Java 1.1 and Java 1.2 provide extensive support for cryptography with an elegant architecture, the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA). Another set of classes, the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), provides additional cryptographic functionality. This book covers the JCA and the JCE from top to bottom, describing the use of the cryptographic classes as well as their innards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is designed for moderately experienced Java programmers who want to learn how to build cryptography into their applications. No prior knowledge of cryptography is assumed. The book is peppered with useful examples, ranging from simple demonstrations in the first chapter to full-blown applications in later chapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cryptographic providers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sun key management tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message digests, digital signatures, and certificates (X509v3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Block and stream ciphers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementations of the ElGamal signature and cipher algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A network talk application that encrypts all data sent over the network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An email application that encrypts its messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covers JDK 1.2 and JCE 1.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java Cryptography&lt;/i&gt; teaches you how to write secure programs using Java's cryptographic tools. It includes thorough discussions of the java.security package and the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE), showing you how to use security providers and even implement your own provider. It discusses authentication, key management, public and private key encryption, and includes a secure talk application that encrypts all data sent over the network. If you work with sensitive data, you'll find this book indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting data across platforms and formats is a cornerstone of  present-day applications development. &lt;i&gt;ADO: ActiveX Data Objects&lt;/i&gt; is both  an introduction and a complete reference to ADO (ActiveX Data Objects),  Microsoft's universal data access solution. You'll learn how to easily  access data in multiple formats--such as email messages, Access  databases, Word documents, and SQL databases--even on different  platforms, without spending extra time learning every last detail about  each format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Jason Roff shows by example how to use ADO with your programming  language of choice to save programming time, so you can concentrate on  the content and quality of your application rather than the nitty-gritty  of specific data formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ADO: ActiveX Data Objects&lt;/i&gt; includes:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Chapters dedicated to the Connection, Recordset, Field,  and Command objects and the Properties collection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;A complete, detailed reference listing every ADO object,  method, property, and event, in convenient alphabetical order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Chapters on ADO architecture, data shaping, the ADO  Event Model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;An appendix containing enumeration tables used by ADO  objects and collections, listed alphabetically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Brief introductions to RDS, ADO.NET, and SQL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ADO: ActiveX Data Objects&lt;/i&gt; is a versatile one-stop guide to both  the theory and practice of programming with ADO through Version 2.6. The  thorough reference section and topic-specific chapters will help you  find quick answers about the details of objects, collections, methods,  and properties of ADO. And the abundance of practical code examples will  give you a good grasp of how to use ADO's strong points most  effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is a one-stop guide to ADO, the universal data access solution from Microsoft that allows easy access to data from multiple formats and platforms.

    <title>Windows 98 Annoyances</title>
    <author>David A. Karp</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An operating system is a piece of software that should do its work in the background while you do your work in the foreground. In an ideal world, that's precisely how an operating system would work. In our world, however, operating systems constantly get in our way. They annoy us. And few are more annoying than Microsoft Windows 98. Perhaps you're annoyed with the icons that Windows deposits on your desktop and that you never use. Or you're frustrated with the new elements of the Windows 98 interface. Or you consider Windows 98's central feature, its integration of Windows and the Web, to be a massive inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Windows 98 Annoyances&lt;/i&gt;, you can put an end to these and countless other annoyances. Given the book's format, which presents particular problems and immediately offers one or more solutions, you can quickly identify the Windows 98 features that most annoy you and equally quickly provide a fix for them. In the process, you'll take charge of Windows so that it works the way you want, rather than the way that Microsoft or some other software publisher has configured it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the author's extremely popular &lt;a href="http://www.annoyances.org" target="new"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Windows Annoyances&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; web site (&lt;a href="http://www.annoyances.org"&gt;http://www.annoyances.org&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Windows 98 Annoyances&lt;/i&gt; provides an authoritative collection of techniques for customizing Windows 98, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Useful keyboard shortcuts that let you work with Windows 98 more efficiently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Techniques for working with the Windows registry, the database of system and application-specific configuration information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Available third-party software and utilities that handle some of the more complex workarounds and customizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dealing with software applications that overwrite your file associations without warning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion of scripting with the Windows Scripting Host as a means of eliminating many of the Windows 98's annoyances to be the definitive resource for customizing Windows 98.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on the author's popular &lt;a href="http://www.annoyances.org" target="new"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Windows Annoyances&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; web site, this book provides an authoritative collection of techniques for customizing Windows 98.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Programming on the Web today can involve any of several technologies, but the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) has held its ground as the most mature method--and one of the most powerful ones--of providing dynamic web content. CGI is a generic interface for calling external programs to crunch numbers, query databases, generate customized graphics, or perform any other server-side task. There was a time when CGI was the only game in town for server-side programming; today, although we have ASP, PHP, Java servlets, and ColdFusion (among others), CGI continues to be the most ubiquitous server-side technology on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CGI programs can be written in any programming language, but Perl is by far the most popular language for CGI. Initially developed over a decade ago for text processing, Perl has evolved into a powerful object-oriented language, while retaining its simplicity of use. CGI programmers appreciate Perl's text manipulation features and its CGI.pm module, which gives a well-integrated object-oriented  interface to practically all CGI-related tasks. While other  languages might be more elegant or more efficient, Perl is still  considered the primary language for CGI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;CGI Programming with Perl,&lt;/i&gt; Second Edition, offers a comprehensive  explanation of using CGI to serve dynamic web content. Based on the best-selling &lt;i&gt;CGI Programming on the World Wide Web,&lt;/i&gt; this edition has been completely rewritten to demonstrate current techniques available with the CGI.pm module and the latest versions of Perl. The book starts at the beginning,  by explaining how CGI works, and then moves swiftly into the  subtle details of developing CGI programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporating JavaScript for form validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling browser caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making CGI scripts secure in Perl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating simple search engines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining state between multiple sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating graphics dynamically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving performance of your CGI scripts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tcl language and Tk graphical toolkit are simple and powerful building blocks for custom applications. The Tcl/Tk combination is increasingly popular because it lets you produce sophisticated graphical interfaces with a few easy commands, develop and change scripts quickly, and conveniently tie together existing utilities or programming libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the attractive features of Tcl/Tk is the wide variety of commands, many offering a wealth of options. Most of the things you'd like to do have been anticipated by the language's creator, John Ousterhout, or one of the developers of Tcl/Tk's many powerful extensions. Thus, you'll find that a command or option probably exists to provide just what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's why it's valuable to have a quick reference that briefly describes every command and option in the core Tcl/Tk distribution as well as the most popular extensions. Keep this book on your desk as you write scripts, and you'll be able to find almost instantly the particular option you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most chapters consist of alphabetical listings. Since Tk and mega-widget packages break down commands by widget, the chapters on these topics are organized by widget along with a section of core  commands where appropriate. Contents include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Core Tcl and Tk commands and Tk widgets
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C interface (prototypes)
&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Oracle Scripts</title>
    <author>Brian Lomasky, David C. Kreines</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book provides a powerful set of tools for Oracle database administrators and developers. During their many  years of administering, tuning, and troubleshooting Oracle databases, the authors have developed hundreds of useful scripts. Now you can instantly take advantage of their experience by putting these scripts to work at your own site.   DBAs and developers are constantly reinventing the wheel. Most Oracle sites have similar requirements, problems, and  crises, and at most of these sites DBAs and developers  find themselves reinventing the wheel by writing the same  kinds of scripts -- and too often they're writing them under  pressure, in hit-or-miss and error-prone fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scripts in this book are tried-and-true. They've been  thoroughly tested in many different environments. You can use  them right now to simplify the tasks you perform each day --  monitoring databases for reliability, protecting your database  against data loss, improving performance, increasing security,  and building reports that provide insight into the inner workings  of Oracle databases. You can also turn to these scripts in  emergencies to diagnose system problems and repair databases  when the pressure is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Scripts for DBAs -- The ways that DBAs structure files, allocate disk space, tune systems, and enforce security have an enormous  impact on how efficiently and effectively systems will operate.  The scripts in this category analyze performance, check database  reliability, produce security and auditing reports, perform backups  and restores, and work with the Oracle Applications.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Scripts for developers and designers -- These scripts help to create, analyze, report, and reverse-engineer the objects in the  database. They also allow developers to easily create EXPLAIN PLAN  reports on SQL statements, and they provide a front end to RCS  (the Revision Control System).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Utility scripts -- These scripts perform a variety of operating  system, file, directory, and memory operations (aimed particularly  at UNIX sites). You can customize these scripts for your own operating system.   The accompanying CD-ROM provides a comprehensive resource for DBAs  and developers. It contains complete source code for all of the scripts  described in this book, as well as additional software that you will find  helpful in monitoring and improving the performance of your databases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brief table of contents follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part I: Overview      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Mastering Algorithms with C</title>

      <subject>COMPUTERS</subject>
      <subject>Data Processing</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many books on data structures and algorithms, including some with useful libraries of C functions. &lt;i&gt;Mastering Algorithms with C&lt;/i&gt; offers you a unique combination of theoretical background and working code. With robust solutions for everyday programming tasks, this book avoids the abstract style of most classic data structures and algorithms texts, but still provides all of the information you need to understand the purpose and use of common programming techniques.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementations, as well as interesting, real-world examples of each data structure and algorithm, are included.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using both a programming style and a writing style that are exceptionally clean, Kyle Loudon shows you how to use such essential data structures as lists, stacks, queues, sets, trees, heaps, priority queues, and graphs. He explains how to use algorithms for sorting, searching, numerical analysis, data compression, data encryption, common graph problems, and computational geometry. And he describes the relative efficiency of all implementations. The compression and encryption chapters not only give you working code for reasonably efficient solutions, they offer explanations of concepts in an approachable manner for people who never have had the time or expertise to study them in depth.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a basic understanding of the C language can use this book. In order to provide maintainable and extendible code, an extra level of abstraction (such as pointers to functions) is used in examples where appropriate. Understanding that these techniques may be unfamiliar to some programmers, Loudon explains them clearly in the introductory chapters.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contents include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pointers
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recursion
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analysis of algorithms
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data structures (lists, stacks, queues, sets, hash tables, trees, heaps, priority queues, graphs)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorting and searching
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numerical methods
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data compression
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data encryption
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graph algorithms
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Geometric algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mastering Algorithms with C&lt;/i&gt; offers robust solutions for everyday programming tasks, and provides all of the necessary information to understand and use common programming techniques. It includes implementations and real-world examples of each data structure. This book is ideal for anyone with a basic understanding of the C language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Windows 2000 Performance  Guide</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is characteristic of most computer systems that they do not degrade  gradually. The painful reality is that performance is acceptable day  after day, until quite suddenly it all falls apart. When this happens,  the administrator needs to be prepared to help the organization get  through the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer applications are growing ever more intelligent and easy to use.  One of the by-products of making applications easier to use is that they  usually also require more resources to run. And wherever productivity is  a central factor in the decisions you make, performance considerations  loom large and continue to play an important role in system management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you wondering, for example, if more expensive equipment would give  better performance? The answer is often yes, but not always. This book  will show you why it is important to understand the performance  characteristics of the hardware and of the workload, and how they match  up against each other. &lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Performance Guide&lt;/i&gt; takes you  through problem solving techniques like measurement methodology,  workload characterization, benchmarking, decomposition techniques, and  analytic queuing models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Processor performance
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Application profiling and hardware considerations
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Multiprocessing
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Memory and paging
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;File cache
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Disk performance
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Networking
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;IIS
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The horror stories of failed development projects that did not meet cost  and performance specifications reflect the fact that expectations about  what computer technology can do far exceed the reality. Even as hardware  performance continues to improve, managing performance will not get  perceptibly easier. This book will give you the tools and information  you need to meet the challenges of performance management now and in the  future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the popular computer books out there promise easy answers, but  this is the only book for those tricky situations that have no direct  precedent. &lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Performance Guide&lt;/i&gt; will give you the  information and the conceptual framework to become your own Windows 2000  performance expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Most computer systems do not degrade gradually. The painful reality is that performance is acceptable day after day, until quite suddenly it all falls apart. If this happens on a system you're responsible for, you'll need to be prepared to get your organization through the crisis. &lt;i&gt;Windows 2000 Performance Guide&lt;/i&gt; will give you the information and the conceptual framework to become your own Windows 2000 performance expert.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet's "killer app" is not the World Wide Web or Push technologies:  it is humble electronic mail. More people use email than any other Internet  application. As the number of email users swells, and as email takes on an ever greater role in personal and business communication, Internet mail protocols have become not just an enabling technology for messaging, but a programming interface on top of which core applications are built.
&lt;i&gt;Programming Internet Email&lt;/i&gt; unmasks the Internet Mail System and shows  how a loose federation of connected networks have combined to form the  world's largest and most heavily trafficked message system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Internet Email&lt;/i&gt; tames the Internet's most popular  messaging service. For programmers building applications on top of  email capabilities, and power users trying to get under the hood of  their own email systems, &lt;i&gt;Programming Internet Email&lt;/i&gt; stands out  as an essential guide and reference book. In typical O'Reilly fashion,
&lt;i&gt;Programming Internet Email&lt;/i&gt; covers the topic with nineteen tightly  written chapters and five useful appendixes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a thorough introduction to the Internet Mail System, the book is  divided into five parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part I covers email formats, from basic text messages to the  guts of MIME.  Secure email message formats (OpenPGP and S/MIME),  mailbox formats and other commonly used formats are detailed in  this reference section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part II describes Internet email protocols: SMTP and ESMTP,  POP3 and IMAP4. Each protocol is covered in detail to expose the  Internet Mail System's inner workings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part III provides a solid API reference for programmers working  in Perl and Java. Class references are given for commonly used Perl  modules that relate to email and the Java Mail API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part IV provides clear and concise examples of how to incorporate email  capabilities into your applications. Examples are given in both Perl and  Java.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part V covers the future of email on the Internet. Means and methods for  controlling spam email and newly proposed Internet mail protocols are  discussed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appendixes to Programming Internet Email provide a host of explanatory  information and useful references for the programmer and avid user alike,  including a comprehensive list of Internet RFCs relating to email, MIME  types and a list of email related URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming Internet Email&lt;/i&gt; will answer all of your questions  about mail and extend your abilities into this most popular messaging frontier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Internet mail protocols have become not just an enabling technology for messaging, but a programming interface on top of which core applications are built. This book is an essential guide and reference for programmers building applications on top of email capabilities and for power users trying to get under the hood of their own email systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One weakness of Java has been its graphics capabilities. Java 1.0  and 1.1 only included simple primitives for line drawing: lines  could only be one pixel wide, they could only be solid, and there  wasn't any good way to draw curves. Font management and color management  were also weak. Java 2D (collectively called the "2D API") signals a  major improvement in Java's graphics capabilities. It covers many of the  classes in Java 1.2 that address graphics handling and improves on many  weaknesses that were present in the previous versions of Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2D API allows you to produce high-quality, professional images on a screen or printer. &lt;i&gt;Java 2D Graphics&lt;/i&gt; describes the 2D API from top  to bottom, demonstrating how to set line styles and pattern fills as well  as more advanced techniques of image processing and font handling. You'll  see how to create and manipulate the three types of graphics objects: shapes,  text, and images. Other topics include image data storage, color management,  font glyphs, and printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Java 2D Graphics&lt;/i&gt; assumes no prior knowledge of graphics. Chock full of detailed explanations and examples, this book provides beginning Java programmers with a solid foundation in 2D graphics and helps more advanced programmers create and use high-quality images in their applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered in the book include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The rendering pipeline
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shapes and paths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geometry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Painting with solid colors, gradients, and textures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stroking paths, including dashed lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transformations: translation, rotation, shearing, and scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alpha compositing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clipping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rasterizing and antialiasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fonts and text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Font metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glyphs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colors and color spaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sRGB and CIEXYZ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ICC color profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Images, image color models, and image data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image data storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Printing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be more productive and make your life easier. That's what &lt;i&gt;LDAP System Administration&lt;/i&gt; is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System administrators often spend a great deal of time managing configuration information located on many different machines: usernames, passwords, printer configurations, email client configurations, and network filesystem configurations, to name a few. LDAPv3 provides tools for centralizing all of the configuration information and placing it under your control. Rather than maintaining several administrative databases (NIS, Active Directory, Samba, and NFS configuration files), you can make changes in only one place and have all your systems immediately "see" the updated information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practically platform independent, this book uses the widely available, open source OpenLDAP 2 directory server as a premise for examples, showing you how to use it to help you manage your configuration information effectively and securely. OpenLDAP 2 ships with most Linux&amp;#174; distributions and Mac OS&amp;#174; X, and can be easily downloaded for most Unix-based systems. After introducing the workings of a directory service and the LDAP protocol, all aspects of building and installing OpenLDAP, plus key ancillary packages like SASL and OpenSSL, this book discusses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configuration and access control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed directories; replication and referral&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using OpenLDAP to replace NIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using OpenLDAP to manage email configurations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using LDAP for abstraction with FTP and HTTP servers, Samba, and Radius&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interoperating with different LDAP servers, including Active Directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming using Net::LDAP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If you want to be a master of your domain, &lt;i&gt;LDAP System Administration&lt;/i&gt; will help you get up and running quickly regardless of which LDAP version you use. After reading this book, even with no previous LDAP experience, you'll be able to integrate a directory server into essential network services such as mail, DNS, HTTP, and SMB/CIFS.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macromedia Director 6 is the premiere authoring tool for delivering  interactive content on both the Internet and the desktop. It is the  dominant multimedia package for Windows 95/NT, Windows 3.1, and the  Macintosh. A quarter million developers use Director&amp;#174; to incorporate animation and audio into dynamic Web pages, and to create engaging  interactive corporate presentations, multimedia advertising, entertainment  CD-ROMs, Enhanced music CDs, and even DVDs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lingo is Director's powerful scripting language. This companion book to
&lt;i&gt;Director in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is an essential tool for both new and experienced  Lingo programmers seeking a deeper knowledge of the language. Bruce  Epstein is the author of both these books and brings years of hands-on  experience with Director and Lingo. The book includes numerous useful Lingo  examples. Exhaustively tested, this book corrects many errors found in  Macromedia's Lingo documentation and repeated verbatim in most third-party  books. Extremely comprehensive, this book details dozens of misdocumented  and undocumented Lingo keywords that are omitted from Macromedia's manuals  and third-party books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lingo in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; caters to the huge pool of Director users attempting  to bridge the Lingo gap, yet provides the details for the experienced  Linguist that are lacking in other Lingo books. In typical nutshell style  (clear, concise, deep and narrow) this book explores the syntax, structure  and commands of the Lingo language. The detailed chapters describe messages,  events, scripts, handlers, variables, lists, file I/O, Behaviors, child  objects, Xtras, and more. This book teaches you to troubleshoot and debug  common Lingo errors. &lt;i&gt;Lingo in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the book for which both  Director users and power Lingo programmers have been yearning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book extensively covers topics not found in other Lingo books:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cross-platform Lingo differences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lingo internals for experienced programmers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events, messages, and scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timers, tempos, cue points, and synchronization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data types and expressions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math, numerical expressions, geometry, and trigonometry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordinates, alignment, and registration point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lingo in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the most concise and compete guide available. It  is a high-end handbook at a low-end price. An essential desktop reference  for every Director user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This companion book to &lt;i&gt;Director in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; covers all aspects of Lingo, Director's powerful scripting language, and is the book for which both Director users and power Lingo programmers have been yearning.

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind every web transaction lies the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)  --- the language of web browsers and servers, of portals and search engines, of e-commerce and web services.  Understanding HTTP is essential for practically all web-based programming, design, analysis, and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the basics of HTTP are elegantly simple, the protocol's advanced features are notoriously confusing, because they knit together complex technologies and terminology from many disciplines.  This book clearly explains HTTP and these interrelated core technologies, in twenty-one logically organized chapters, backed up by hundreds of detailed illustrations and examples, and convenient reference appendices.  &lt;i&gt;HTTP: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; explains everything people need to use HTTP efficiently -- including the "black arts" and "tricks of the trade" -- in a concise and readable manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to explaining the basic HTTP features, syntax and guidelines, this book clarifies related, but often misunderstood topics, such as: TCP connection management, web proxy and cache architectures, web robots and robots.txt files, Basic and Digest authentication, secure HTTP transactions, entity body processing, internationalized content, and traffic redirection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many technical professionals will benefit from this book.  Internet architects and developers who need to design and develop software, IT professionals who need to understand Internet architectural components and interactions, multimedia designers who need to publish and host multimedia, performance engineers who need to optimize web performance, technical marketing professionals who need a clear picture of core web architectures and protocols, as well as untold numbers of students and hobbyists will all benefit from the knowledge packed in this volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many books that explain how to use the Web, but this is the one that explains how the Web works.  Written by experts with years of design and implementation experience, this book is the definitive technical bible that describes the "why" and the "how" of HTTP and web core technologies.  &lt;i&gt;HTTP: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; is an essential reference that no technically-inclined member of the Internet community should be without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web technology has become the foundation for all sorts of critical networked applications and far-reaching methods of data exchange, and beneath it all is a fundamental protocol: HyperText Transfer Protocol, or HTTP.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;HTTP: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; documents everything that technical people need for using HTTP efficiently.  A reader can understand how web applications work, how the core Internet protocols and architectural building blocks interact, and how to correctly implement Internet clients and servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

    <title>Managing NFS and NIS</title>

      <subject>Operating Systems</subject>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A modern computer system that's not part of a network is even more of an anomaly today than it was when we published the first edition of this book in 1991. But however widespread networks have become, managing a network and getting it to perform well can still be a problem.
&lt;i&gt;Managing NFS and NIS,&lt;/i&gt; in a new edition based on Solaris 8, is a guide to two tools that are absolutely essential to distributed computing environments: the Network Filesystem (NFS) and the Network Information System (formerly called the "yellow pages" or YP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Network Filesystem, developed by Sun Microsystems, is fundamental to most Unix networks. It lets systems ranging from PCs and Unix workstations to large mainframes access each other's files transparently, and is the standard method for sharing files between different computer systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As popular as NFS is, it's a "black box" for most users and administrators. Updated for NFS Version 3, &lt;i&gt;Managing NFS and NIS&lt;/i&gt; offers detailed access to what's inside, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to plan, set up, and debug an NFS network
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using the NFS automounter
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diskless workstations
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;PC/NFS
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new transport protocol for NFS (TCP/IP)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New security options (IPSec and Kerberos V5)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diagnostic tools and utilities
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NFS client and server tuning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFS isn't really complete without its companion, NIS, a distributed database service for managing the most important administrative files, such as the &lt;b&gt;passwd&lt;/b&gt; file and the &lt;b&gt;hosts&lt;/b&gt; file. NIS centralizes administration of commonly replicated files, allowing a single change to the database rather than requiring changes on every system on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are managing a network of Unix systems, or are thinking of setting up a Unix network, you can't afford to overlook this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This long-awaited new edition of a classic, now updated for NFS Version 3 and based on Solaris 8, shows how to set up and manage a network filesystem installation. &lt;i&gt;Managing NFS and NIS &lt;/i&gt;is the only practical book devoted entirely to NFS and the distributed database NIS; it's a "must-have" for anyone interested in Unix networking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Oracle Database Administration: The Essential Refe</title>
    <author>David C. Kreines, Brian Laskey</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle database administration requires a vast amount of information and  an ability to perform a myriad of tasks--from installation to tuning to  network troubleshooting to overall daily administration. Oracle provides  many tools for performing these tasks; the trick is knowing what tool is  right for the job, what commands you need to issue (and when), and what  parameters and privileges you need to set. And, as every DBA knows, you  need to know how do all this under pressure, while you face crisis after  crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book provides a concise reference to the enormous store of information  an Oracle DBA needs every day (as well as what's needed only when disaster  strikes).  It's crammed full of quick-reference tables, task lists, and other  summary material that both novice and expert DBAs will use time and time again. It covers the commands and operations new to Oracle8, but also provides Oracle7 information for sites still running earlier versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oracle Database Administration&lt;/i&gt; provides two types of material:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;DBA tasks--chapters summarizing how to perform critical DBA functions:  installation, performance tuning, preventing data loss, networking, security  and monitoring, auditing, query optimization, and the use of various Oracle  tools and utilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;DBA reference--chapters providing a quick reference to the Oracle  instance and database, the initialization (INIT.ORA) parameters, the SQL  statements commonly used by DBAs, the data dictionary tables, the system  privileges and roles, and the SQL*Plus, Export, Import, and SQL*Loader syntax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book also includes a resource summary with references to additional books,  Web sites, and other online and offline resources of special use to Oracle DBAs.
&lt;i&gt;Oracle Database Administration&lt;/i&gt; is the single essential reference  you'll turn to again and again. If you must choose only one book to use at the  office, keep at home, or carry to a site you're troubleshooting, this will be that book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

With Tk, Perl programs can be window-based rather  than command-line based, with buttons, entry fields, listboxes, menus,  scrollbars, balloons, tables, dialogs, and more. And Perl/Tk programs  run on UNIX and Windows-based computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small book is a handy reference guide geared toward the advanced Perl/Tk programmer. Novice Perl/Tk programmers will find that its compact size gives them a global view of Perl/Tk's capabilities; they can then  turn to &lt;i&gt;Learning Perl/Tk&lt;/i&gt; for details. The &lt;i&gt;Perl/Tk Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; describes every Perl/Tk graphical element, including general widget and variable information, callbacks, geometry management, bindings, events, and window management, as well as composite widget, font, and image creation  and manipulation commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, only large companies could afford secure networks, which they created from expensive leased lines. Smaller folks had to make do with the relatively untrusted Internet. Nowadays, even large companies have to go outside their private nets, because so many people telecommute or log in while they're on the road. How do you provide a low-cost, secure electronic network for your organization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is a virtual private network: a collection of technologies  that creates secure connections or "tunnels" over regular Internet  lines--connections that can be easily used by anybody logging in  from anywhere. A number of products now exist to help you develop that solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book tells you how to plan and build a VPN. It starts with general concerns like costs, configuration, and how a VPN fits in with other networking technologies like firewalls. It continues with detailed descriptions of how to install and use VPN technologies  that are available for Windows NT and Unix, such as PPTP and L2TP,  Altavista Tunnel, Cisco PIX, and the secure shell (SSH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New features in the second edition include SSH, which is a popular VPN solution for Unix systems, and an expanded description of the IPSec  standard, for which several vendors have announced support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How the VPN compares to other available networking technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Introduction to encryption, firewalls, the IPSec standard, and  other technologies that let VPNs work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) and L2TP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The Altavista Tunnel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The Cisco PIX Firewall&lt;/li&gt;

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the World Wide Web, speed and efficiency are vital.  Users have little patience for slow web pages, while network administrators want to make the most of their available bandwidth.  A properly designed web cache reduces network traffic and improves access times to popular web sites--a boon to network administrators and web users alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Web Caching&lt;/i&gt; hands you all the technical information you need to design, deploy, and operate an effective web caching service.  It starts with the basics of how web caching works, from the HTTP headers that govern cachability to cache validation and replacement algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered in this book include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Designing an effective cache solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Configuring web browsers to use a cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Setting up a collection of caches that can talk to each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Configuring an interception cache or proxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Monitoring and fine-tuning the performance of a cache&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Configuring web servers to cooperate with web caches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Benchmarking cache products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book also covers the important political aspects of web caching, including privacy, intellectual property, and security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet service providers, large corporations, or educational institutions--in short, any network that provides connectivity to a wide variety of users--can reap enormous benefit from running a well-tuned web caching service. &lt;i&gt;Web Caching&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A properly designed web cache, by reducing network traffic and improving access times to popular web sites, is a boon to network administrators and web users alike.

    <title>Crossing Platforms A Macintosh/Windows Phrasebook</title>
    <author>Adam Engst, David Pogue</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like travelers in a foreign land, Mac users working in Windows or  Windows users working on a Mac often find themselves in unfamiliar  territory with no guidebook. &lt;i&gt;Crossing Platforms: A  Macintosh/Windows Phrasebook&lt;/i&gt;, with information presented in a  translation dictionary-like format, offers users a handy way of  translating skills and knowledge from one platform to the other. Whether it's explaining the difference between Macintosh
&lt;i&gt;aliases&lt;/i&gt; and Windows &lt;i&gt;shortcuts&lt;/i&gt; or explaining how a  Windows user would go about setting up Internet access on a Mac, this  book provides readers a simple means to look up familiar interface  elements and system features and learn how that element or feature  works on the other platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crossing Platforms: A Macintosh/Windows Phrasebook&lt;/i&gt; includes:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;A general introduction to the key differences between the Mac and Windows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;A to Z sections for each platform: one section where Mac users  look up familiar Macintosh terms to find the equivalent function in  Windows along with an explanation of the differences; and another  section where Windows users find familiar Windows terms with pointers  to the Macintosh equivalent along with full descriptions of how the  function works on the Mac and important differences between the two  platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete translation dictionary-like reference book,
&lt;i&gt;Crossing Platforms: A Macintosh/Windows Phrasebook&lt;/i&gt; provides a  simple solution for everyone who has been confused and frustrated by  the arbitrary and sometimes capricious differences between the  Macintosh and Windows operating systems. This book bridges the Mac-PC  knowledge gap many users are faced with when work or preference  demands the use of both a PC and Mac. Whether you already know the  Macintosh or Windows, this book helps you navigate in the other  operating system using your existing skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Like travelers in a foreign land, Mac users working in Windows or Windows users working on a Mac often find themselves in unfamiliar territory with no guidebook. &lt;i&gt;Crossing Platforms: A Macintosh/Windows Phrasebook&lt;/i&gt; offers users a handy way of translating skills and knowledge from one platform to the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Exchange is a big, complicated application; it requires  more disk storage than Windows NT Server and has several hundred  configuration property pages and dialogs. But it is also a very  powerful and flexible messaging system. However, knowing that  it can be made to do something and understanding how to do it are  often worlds apart. &lt;i&gt;Managing Microsoft Exchange Server&lt;/i&gt; bridges  this gap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a no-nonsense, practical guide to planning, installing,  managing, maintaining, and troubleshooting Exchange networks. Targeted at medium-sized installations and up, &lt;i&gt;Managing Microsoft Exchange Server&lt;/i&gt; addresses the difficult problems these users face:  Internet integration, storage management, cost of ownership, system  security, and performance management. It goes beyond the basics to  provide real hands-on advice about what you need to know after you have your first site up-and-running and are facing issues of growth,  optimization, or recovery planning. &lt;i&gt;Managing Microsoft Exchange Server&lt;/i&gt;  comprehensively explains how Exchange works, what it can do, and how  you can make it work for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apache is the most popular web server on the Internet because it is free, reliable, and extensible. The  availability of the source code and the modular design  of Apache makes it possible to extend web server  functionality through the Apache API.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, however, the Apache API has only  been available to C programmers, and requires rebuilding the Apache server from source. mod_perl, the popular  Apache module used primarily for enhanced CGI performance,  changed all that by making the Apache API available to Perl programmers. With mod_perl, it becomes simple  to develop Apache modules with Perl and install them  without having to rebuild the web server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C&lt;/i&gt; shows how to extend  web server capabilities regardless of whether  the programming language is Perl or C. The  book explains the design of Apache, mod_perl, and the  Apache API. It then demonstrates how to use them to  perform for tasks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rewriting CGI scripts as Apache modules to  vastly improve performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server-side filtering of HTML documents, to embed special markup or code (much like SSI)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancing server log functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converting file formats on the fly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing dynamic navigation bars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporating database access into CGI scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customizing access control and authorization to  block robots or to use an external database for passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors are Lincoln Stein and Doug MacEachern. Lincoln is the successful author of &lt;i&gt;How to Set Up and Maintain a World Wide web Site&lt;/i&gt; and the developer of the widely used Perl CGI.pm  module. Doug is a consultant and the creator of the innovative  mod_perl Apache module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This guide to web programming shows how to extend the capabilities of the Apache web server. It explains the design of Apache, mod_perl, and the Apache API, then demonstrates how to use them to rewrite CGI scripts, filter HTML documents on the server-side, enhance server log functionality, convert file formats on the fly, and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've ever been responsible for a network, you know that sinkingfeeling: your pager has gone off at 2 a.m., the network is broken, and you can't figure out why by using a dial-in connection from home. You drive into the office, dig out your protocol analyzer, and spend the next four
hours trying to put things back together before the staff shows up for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happens, you often find yourself looking at the low-level guts of the Internet protocols: you're deciphering individual packets, trying to figure out what is (or isn't) happening. Until now, the only real guide to the protocols has been the Internet RFCs--and they're hardly
what you want to be reading late at night when your network is down. There hasn't been a good book on the fundamentals of IP networking aimed at network administrators--until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet Core Protocols: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; contains all the information you need for low-level network debugging. It provides thorough coverage of the fundamental protocols in the TCP/IP suite: IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP (in its many variations), and IGMP. (The companion volume, &lt;i&gt;Internet Application Protocols: The Definitive Guide,&lt;/i&gt;
provides detailed information about the commonly used application protocols, including HTTP, FTP, DNS, POP3, and many others). It includes many packet captures, showing you what to look for and how to interpret all the fields. It has been brought up to date with the latest developments in real-world IP networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CD-ROM included with the book contains Shomiti's "Surveyor Lite," a packet analyzer that runs on Win32 systems, plus the original RFCs, should you need them for reference. Together, this package includes everything you need to troubleshoot your network--except coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet Core Protocols: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; provides the nitty-gritty details of TCP, IP, and UDP. Many network problems can only be debugged by working at the lowest levels--looking at all the bits traveling back and forth on the wire. This guide explains what those bits are and how to interpret them. It's the only book on Internet protocols written with system and network administrators in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a serious information gap for Webmasters learning client-side JavaScript skills and trying to solve common Web-related problems. Knowing the syntax is one thing, being able to build a useful application is another. And while there are dozens of "how- to" JavaScript books available, few literally hand the Webmaster a set of ready-to-go, client-side JavaScript applications with thorough documentation that enable the reader to fully understand and extend those applications. By providing such a set of applications, &lt;i&gt;JavaScript Application Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; allows Webmasters to immediately add extra functionality to their Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book targets readers with two different skill sets. The primary target is JavaScript-knowledgeable Webmasters and  designers who can immediately begin constructing their own  versions of the applications. The secondary target is those with little or no JavaScript experience. The included  applications are ready for immediate use and require little  customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book explores both the code and the techniques that are centered around core JavaScript functionality, a functionality  that will not become incompatible or obsolete. The source file  design of most applications and libraries will help modularize  reader Web sites and facilitate easier site management and coding  practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapters are organized by application. Among the included  applications are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A client-side search engine that will show coders how to build their own search engine and get excellent results, all with a client-side tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A drag-and-drop greeting application that lets users custom build and send DHTML email greetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A GUI image rollover tool that generates cross-browser image rollover code for all versions of JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A robust client-side shopping cart application that lets shoppers browse and shop, while the application keeps a tab of the shopper's selections and a running bill, including tax and shipping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An online test application that auto-administers, grades, and displays answers to online exams or surveys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional value to this book is an online resource  (&lt;a href="http://www.serve.com/hotsyte/"&gt;http://www.serve.com/hotsyte/&lt;/a&gt;) that discusses the applications  and points to other resources. With its focus on providing practical real-world solutions for Webmasters, &lt;i&gt;JavaScript  Application Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is destined to become a staple for every JavaScript developer, regardless of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;JavaScript Application Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; literally hands the Webmaster a set of ready-to-go, client-side JavaScript applications with thorough documentation to help them understand and extend the applications. By providing such a set of applications, &lt;i&gt;JavaScript Application Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; allows Webmasters to immediately add extra functionality to their Web sites.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;DocBook: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; is the complete and official documentation of the DocBook Document Type Definition (DTD) and many of its associated tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DocBook is a system for writing structured documents using SGML and XML.   It provides all the elements you'll need for technical documents of  all kinds. A number of computer companies use DocBook for their  documentation, as do several Open Source documentation groups, including  the Linux Documentation Project (LDP).  With the consistent use of  DocBook, these groups can readily share and exchange information. With  an XML-enabled browser, DocBook documents are as accessible on the Web  as in print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;DocBook: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; was written by Norman Walsh, the author of the XML implementation of the DocBook DTD; and Leonard Muellner, the manager of O'Reilly &amp;amp; Associates' Production Tools Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, you'll find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A brief introduction to SGML and XML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A guide to creating documents with the DocBook DTD and associated stylesheets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Information about using SGML and XML tools like Jade and DSSSL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An guide to customizing DocBook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A complete SGML and XML reference, including examples, for every DocBook  element&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the CDROM contains:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The complete source text of this book, in both SGML and HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the examples from the book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DSSSL Stylesheets that let you convert DocBook documents to RTF, LaTeX,  or HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DocBook DTD for SGML, version 3.1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oasis, the organization that is the official maintainer of the DocBook DTD,  has identified &lt;i&gt;DocBook: the Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; as the official documentation for  the DocBook DTD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;DocBook is a Document Type Definition (DTD) for use with XML (the Extensible Markup Language) and SGML (the Standard Generalized Markup Language). DocBook lets authors in technical groups exchange and reuse technical information. This book contains an introduction to SGML, XML, and the DocBook DTD, plus the complete reference information for DocBook.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freely available source code, with contributions from thousands of programmers around the world: this is the spirit of the software  revolution known as Open Source. Open Source has grabbed the computer  industry's attention. Netscape has opened the source code to Mozilla;  IBM supports Apache; major database vendors haved ported their products  to Linux. As enterprises realize the power of the open-source development  model, Open Source is becoming a viable mainstream alternative to  commercial software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in &lt;i&gt;Open Sources&lt;/i&gt;, leaders of Open Source come together for the first time to discuss the new vision of the software industry they have created. The essays in this volume offer insight into how the Open Source movement works, why it succeeds, and where it is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For programmers who have labored on open-source projects, &lt;i&gt;Open Sources&lt;/i&gt; is the new gospel: a powerful vision from the movement's  spiritual leaders. For businesses integrating open-source software  into their enterprise, &lt;i&gt;Open Sources&lt;/i&gt; reveals the mysteries of  how open development builds better software, and how businesses can  leverage freely available software for a competitive business advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contributors here have been the leaders in the open-source arena:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Brian Behlendorf (Apache)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Kirk McKusick (Berkeley Unix)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Tim O'Reilly (Publisher, O'Reilly &amp;amp; Associates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Bruce Perens (Debian Project, Open Source Initiative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Tom Paquin and Jim Hamerly (mozilla.org, Netscape)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Eric Raymond (Open Source Initiative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Richard Stallman (GNU, Free Software Foundation, Emacs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Michael Tiemann (Cygnus Solutions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Linus Torvalds (Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Paul Vixie (Bind)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Larry Wall (Perl)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book explains why the majority of the Internet's servers use open- source technologies for everything from the operating system to Web serving and email. Key technology products developed with open-source software have overtaken and surpassed the commercial efforts of billion dollar companies like Microsoft and IBM to dominate software markets. Learn  the inside story of what led Netscape to decide to release its source  code using the open-source mode. Learn how Cygnus Solutions builds  the world's best compilers by sharing the source code. Learn why  venture capitalists are eagerly watching Red Hat Software, a company  that gives its key product -- Linux -- away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in print, this book presents the story of the open- source phenomenon told by the people who created this movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Open Sources&lt;/i&gt; will bring you into the world of free software and show you the revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Oracle Internals:  An Introduction</title>
    <author>Steve Adams</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concise book contains detailed information about Oracle internals -- information  that's not readily available to Oracle customers. It lays a foundation for advanced performance tuning of the Oracle database.  Based on Oracle8i release 8.1, the book describes many of  the secrets of Oracle's internal services: data  structures, algorithms, and undocumented Oracle system  statistics. Main topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Waits - how Oracle processes communicate via semaphores,  and how to use the Oracle wait statistics to identify the source of performance problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Latches - how they keep multiple processes from inspecting protected data structures at the same time, and how to examine and control latch behavior and statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Locks - how they work with latches to protect data structures (locks allow multiple sessions to share resources  in some cases), and how locks affect performance. There is also a detailed discussion of instance locks, which are used in parallel server environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Memory - how Oracle uses memory (e.g., the various elements of the System Global Area), and how Oracle dynamically allocates and manages memory. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oracle8i Internal Services&lt;/i&gt; is aimed  especially at administrators and developers who need  detailed internal information to do advanced performance tuning. The book will expand your repertoire of tuning solutions  and troubleshooting techniques by explaining how you can use Oracle's  hidden parameters and undocumented system statistics to best advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The author has collected the scripts he has developed for  tuning and analysis into a toolkit (known as APT, for Advanced  Performance Tuning). These scripts access the Oracle X$ tables  directly and provide information not otherwise available. The scripts  are available to readers for free from the O'Reilly web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Based on Oracle8i, release 8.1, this concise book contains detailed, hard-to-find information about Oracle internals (data structures, algorithms, hidden parameters, and undocumented system statistics), Main topics include waits, latches, locks (including instance locks used in parallel server environments), and memory use and management.

    <title>Perl for System Administration</title>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people plan to become administrators. The rest of us are thrust into it: we are webmasters, hobbyists, or just the  default "technical people" on staff who are expected to keep  things running. After some stumbling around repeating the same  steps over and over again (and occasionally paying the price  when we forget one), we realize that we must automate these  tasks, or suffer endless frustration. Thus enters Perl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Perl programming language is ideal for writing quick yet  powerful scripts that automate many administrative tasks.  It's modular, it's powerful, and it's perfect for managing  systems and services on many platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perl for System Administration&lt;/i&gt; is designed for all levels of administrators--from hobbyists to card-carrying SAGE  members--sysadmins on multi-platform sites. Written for several  different platforms (Unix, Windows NT, and Mac OS), it's a guide to the pockets of administration where Perl  can be most useful for sites large and small, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Filesystem management
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;User administration with a dash of XML
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DNS and other network name services
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Database administration using DBI and ODBC
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Directory services and frameworks like LDAP and ADSI
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using email for system administration
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with log files of all kinds

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each chapter concentrates on a single administrative area, discusses the possible pitfalls, and then shows how Perl comes to the rescue. Along the way we encounter  interesting Perl features and tricks, with many extended examples  and complete programs. The scripts included in the book can simply  be used as written or with minimal adaptation. But it's likely that readers will also get a taste of what Perl can do,  and start extending those scripts for tasks that we haven't dreamed of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perl for System Adminstration&lt;/i&gt; doesn't attempt to teach the Perl language, but it is an excellent introduction to the  power and flexibility of Perl, and it whets the appetite to learn more. It's for anyone who needs to use Perl for system administration and needs to hit the ground running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Perl for System Administration&lt;/i&gt; is aimed at all levels of administrators on the Unix, Windows NT, or MacOS platforms. Assuming only a little familiarity with Perl, it explores the pockets of administration where Perl can be most useful, including filesystem management, user administration, directory services, database administration, log files, and security and network monitoring. &lt;i&gt;Perl for System Administration&lt;/i&gt; is for anyone who needs to use Perl for administrative tasks and needs to hit the ground running.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java and databases make a powerful combination. Getting the two sides to  work together, however, takes some effort--largely because Java deals in  objects while most databases do not.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book describes the standard Java interfaces that make portable  object-oriented access to relational databases possible and offers a  robust model for writing applications that are easy to maintain. It  introduces the JDBC and RMI packages and uses them to develop three-tier  applications (applications divided into a user interface, an  object-oriented logic component, and an information store).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The book begins with a quick overview of SQL for developers who may be  asked to handle a database for the first time. It then explains how to  issue database queries and updates through SQL and JDBC. It also covers  the use of stored procedures and other measures to improve efficiency,  where these are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But the book's key contribution is a set of patterns that let developers  isolate critical tasks like object creation, information storage and  retrieval, and the committing or aborting of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second edition includes more basics of JDBC and SQL, with more  examples, and a deeper discussion about the architecture of a robust,  maintainable database application. The second edition also explains the relationship between JDBC and  Enterprise JavaBeans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book describes the standard Java interfaces that make portable object-oriented access to relational databases possible, and offers a robust model for writing applications that are easy to maintain. The second edition has been completely updated for JDBC 2.0, and includes reference listings for JDBC and the most important RMI classes. The book begins with a quick overview of SQL for developers who may be asked to handle a database for the first time, and goes on to explain how to issue database queries and updates through SQL and JDBC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is growing in popularity; based on download statistics, there are  now over 450,000 people using Python, and more than 150,000 people using Python  on Windows.  Use of the language has been growing at about 40% per year since  1995, and there is every reason to believe that growth will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Python's increasing popularity on Windows, &lt;i&gt;Python Programming on  Win32&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to demonstrate how to use it as a serious Windows  development and administration tool.  Unlike scripting on Unix, Windows  scripting involves integrating a number of components, such as COM or the  various mail and database APIs, with the Win32 programming interface.   While experienced Windows C++ programmers can find their way through the  various objects, most people need some guidance, and this book is it.  It  addresses all the basic technologies for common integration tasks on Windows,  explaining both the Windows issues and the Python code you need to glue things  together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Python language and the PythonWin extensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a GUI with COM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding a Macro language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributing the application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client-side COM for output and data access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with mail and other internet protocols&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing users and drives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a vital and unique book.  &lt;i&gt;Python Programming on Win32&lt;/i&gt; is an excellent presentation of Windows application development and a solid  illustration of how to use Python in the Windows environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;qmail has quietly become one of the most widely used applications on the Internet today. It's powerful enough to handle mail for systems with millions of users--Like Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail, while remaining compact and manageable enough for the smallest Unix- and Linux-based PC systems. Its component design makes it easy to extend and customize while keeping its key functions secure, so it's no wonder that adoption of qmail continues at a rapid pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside? Apparently none. Except that qmail's unique design can be disorienting to those familiar with other popular MTAs (Mail Transfer Agents). If you're coming from sendmail, for instance, you might have trouble recasting your problems and solutions in qmail terms. qmail first helps you establish a "qmail frame of mind," then explores the installation, configuration, administration, and extension of this powerful MTA.  Whether you're installing from scratch or managing mailing lists with thousands of users, qmail provides detailed information about how to make qmail do precisely what you want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;qmail concentrates on common tasks like moving a sendmail setup to qmail, or setting up a "POP toaster," a system that provides mail service to a large number of users on other computers sending and retrieving mail remotely. The book also fills crucial gaps in existing documentation, detailing exactly what the core qmail software does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics covered include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installation and configuration, including patching qmail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving from sendmail to qmail&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Handling locally and remotely originated messages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing virtual domains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logging qmail activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tuning qmail performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Running multiple copies of qmail on the same computer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mailing list setup and management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrating the qmail MTA with POP and IMAP delivery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Filtering out spam and viruses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
If you need to manage mailing lists, large volumes of mail, or simply find sendmail and other MTAs too complicated, qmail may be exactly what's called for. Our new guide, qmail, will provide the guidance you need to build an email infrastructure that performs well, makes sense, and is easy to maintain. &lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Win32 API Programming with Visual Basic</title>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Win32 API, or Application Programming Interface, is of immense use in extending the power of Visual Basic. The Win32 API is the collection of functions and subroutines that provides programmatic access to the features of the operating system. It allows Visual Basic programmers far greater access to the inner workings of the Windows operating system without having to suffer through the steep learning curve associated with Visual C++ style Windows programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is designed for users with an intermediate-level (or higher) knowledge of Visual Basic version 4 or later and a desire to stretch VB into the realm of Windows system programming. Users do not need  any background in Visual C++, nor do they need any previous experience  programming the Win32 API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book teaches users how to do relatively simple tasks, such as adding tab stops to a list box and gathering system information (i.e., which version of Windows is running on a system and the number of buttons on the user's mouse). It also teaches users about several advanced programming techniques such as synchronizing two VB applications so they can work in cooperation with each other and how to extract data from controls that belong to another application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Win32 API Programming with Visual Basic&lt;/i&gt; also spends a good deal of time describing the basic operations of the Windows NT and Windows 95/98 operating systems. Microsoft's documentation seldom takes into account what the reader knows or does not know. Hence, a solid grounding in the basics of the Windows operating systems will help VB programmers to better understand Microsoft's documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book helps VB programmers eliminate the trial and error process that is usually associated with calling the Win32 API from Visual Basic and does so in a practical, straightforward fashion that is the hallmark of author Steve Roman's style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This book provides the missing documentation for VB programmers who want to harness the power of accessing the Win32 API within Visual Basic. It shows how to create powerful and unique applications without needing a background in Visual C++ or Win32 API programming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Checking links, batch editing HTML files, tracking users, and writing CGI  scripts--these are the often tedious daily tasks that can be done much more  easily with Perl, the scripting language that runs on almost all computing  platforms. If you're more interested in streamlining your web activities than  in learning a new programming language,  &lt;i&gt;Perl for Web Site Management&lt;/i&gt;  is for you: it's not so much about learning Perl as it is about using Perl to  do common web chores more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret is that, although becoming a Perl expert may be hard, most Perl  scripts are relatively simple. Using Perl and other open source tools,  you'll learn how to:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Incorporate a simple search engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Write a simple CGI gateway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Convert multiple text files into HTML&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Monitor log files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Track users as they navigate your site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you don't have any programming background, this book will get you  quickly past Perl's seemingly forbidding barrier of chops and chomps, execs  and elsifs. You'll be able to put an end to using clunky tools, editing files  tediously by hand, or relying on programmers and system administrators to do  "the hard stuff" for you.  Sure, you might learn a little bit about  programming as well, and perhaps something about the role of open source tools  on the Web. But the purpose of &lt;i&gt;Perl for Web Site Management&lt;/i&gt; isn't to  educate you--it's to empower you. Whether you're a developer, a designer, or  simply a dabbler on the Web, this book is the plain-English, hands-on  introduction to Perl you've been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Learn to do everyday tasks on your web site using Perl--even if you have no programming background. &lt;i&gt;Perl for Web Site Management&lt;/i&gt; shows how to write CGI scripts, incorporate search engines, convert multiple text files to HTML, monitor log files, and track visitors to your site. Whether you're a developer, a designer, or simply a dabbler on the Web, this is the hands-on introduction to Perl you've been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can Windows administrators set up different security restrictions  for different users? Or set one policy for a whole group? Configure  desktops for roving users so that any computer they use will have the  same look? Or protect a computer if it is unplugged from the network?  These are just a few of the questions that &lt;i&gt;Windows System Policy  Editor&lt;/i&gt; answers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows system policy editor is a powerful tool for creating and  editing local registry values to standardize desktop settings, prevent  users from modifying hardware and environment settings, or control or  restrict user actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Windows System Policy Editor&lt;/i&gt; enlightens readers on how to prevent  security problems like file tampering, loss of data as a result of  accidental system software changes, or users being locked out of their  own computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This working manual leads the reader through both a Windows systems  primer and the more complex aspects of:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different types of system policies, what they control, and how to  modify them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing the policy editor and creating the policy file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting default workstation security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the administrative files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The differences between the Win95 and Win98 policy editor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procedures for stand-alone computers as opposed to  networked computers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer security on publicly accessed computers poses unique  challenges, today more than ever before. This book is for anyone who's  in charge of administering workstations in a school, library, office, or  any environment where increased security would be invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethernet is a core networking technology used by every high tech  business. While the basic protocols have changed little, new options  such as Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet have increased the complexity  of the topic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Ethernet has been the flavor of choice for networking administrators  since the early 1980s because of its ease of use and scalability.  Written by one of the foremost experts on Ethernet standards and  configuration, Charles E. Spurgeon, &lt;i&gt;Ethernet: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt;  includes everything you need to know to set up and maintain an Ethernet  network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ethernet: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; teaches you everything you  need to know about the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard and its protocols.  The book is logically separated into five parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Introduction to Ethernet&lt;/b&gt; provides a tour of basic Ethernet  theory and operation, including a description of Ethernet frames,  operation of the Media Access Control (MAC) protocol, full-duplex  mode and auto-negotiation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ethernet Media Systems&lt;/b&gt; is the heart of the book. This  sectionof &lt;i&gt;Ethernet: The Definitive Guide&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to build  media-specific Ethernet networks, from a basic 10BASE-T Ethernet  offering 10 Mbps over twisted-pair cables, to an advanced 1000BASE-X  Gigabit Ethernet, providing up to 1 Gbps of data transfer over  fiber optic cables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building Your Ethernet System&lt;/b&gt; teaches you how to build  twisted-pair and fiber optic media segments, as well as how to build  your Ethernet using repeaters and hubs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance and Troubleshooting&lt;/b&gt; is divided into two  chapters. The first describes both the performance of a given Ethernet channel,  as well as the performance of the entire network system. The second includes a tutorial on troubleshooting techniques and describes the  kinds of problems network administrators are likely to encounter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The last part of the book includes a complete glossary of terms used  throughout the book, a resource list, descriptions of thick and thin  coax-based Ethernet systems, a guide to AUI equipment installation  and configuration, and a listing of troubleshooting numbers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This book is the definitive guide for anyone wanting to build a  scalable local area network (LAN) using Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioinformatics--the application of computational and analytical methods to  biological problems--is a rapidly evolving scientific discipline. Genome  sequencing projects are producing vast amounts of biological data for many  different organisms, and, increasingly, storing these data in public  databases. Such biological databases are growing exponentially, along with  the biological literature. It's impossible for even the most zealous researcher  to stay on top of necessary information in the field without the aid of  computer-based tools. Bioinformatics is all about building these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Developing Bioinformatics Computer Skills&lt;/i&gt; is for scientists and  students who are learning computational approaches to biology for the first  time, as well as for experienced biology researchers who are just starting to  use computers to handle their data. The book covers the Unix file system,  building tools and databases for bioinformatics, computational approaches to  biological problems, an introduction to Perl for bioinformatics, data  mining, and data visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in a clear, engaging style, &lt;i&gt;Developing Bioinformatics Computer  Skills&lt;/i&gt; will help biologists develop a structured approach to biological  data as well as the tools they'll need to analyze the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However excellent they are, most computer books are inherently passive--readers simply take in text without having any opportunity to react  to it. &lt;i&gt;The Oracle PL/SQL Developer's Workbook&lt;/i&gt; is a different kind of animal! It's designed to engage you actively, to  get you solving programming problems immediately, and to help you apply what you've learned about  PL/SQL--and in the process deepen your knowledge of the language. By tackling the exercises in this workbook, you'll find yourself moving more rapidly along the learning curve to join the growing ranks of PL/SQL experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Oracle PL/SQL Developer's Workbook&lt;/i&gt;  is a companion to Steven Feuerstein's bestselling &lt;i&gt;Oracle PL/SQL Programming&lt;/i&gt; and his other PL/SQL books from O'Reilly. It contains a carefully constructed set of problems and solutions that will test your language skills and help  you become a better developer--both with PL/SQL and with other languages. Exercises are provided  at three levels: beginner, intermediate, and expert. The workbook exercises cover all the major features of  PL/SQL, including those new to Oracle8i (e.g., Java and web features, autonomous transactions, and bulk binds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll find chapters on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Basic language elements--variables, naming, loops, conditional and sequential control, exception handling, and records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Data structures--index-by tables, nested tables, variables arrays (VARRAYs), and object technology.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Database interaction--cursors, DML and transaction management, cursor variables, and native dynamic SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Program construction--procedures, functions, blocks, packages, database triggers, and calling PL/SQL functions in SQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Built-in functionality--the character, date, conversion, numeric, and miscellaneous functions, and the DBMS_SQL, DBMS_PIPE, DBMS_OUTPUT, UTL_FILE, and DBMS_JOB built-in packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Miscellaneous topics--using Java with PL/SQL, external programs, PL/SQL web development, tuning PL/SQL, and PL/SQL for DBAs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A companion to Feuerstein's other bestselling Oracle PL/SQL books, this workbook presents a carefully constructed set of problems and solutions that will test your language skills and help you become a better developer. Three levels of exercises--beginner, intermediate, and expert--cover the full set of language features. These include variables, loops, exception handling, data structures, object technology, cursors, built-in functions and packages, PL/SQL tuning, and the new Oracle8i features (including Java and the Web).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Malicious Mobile Code</title>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malicious mobile code is a new term to describe all sorts of destructive  programs: viruses, worms, Trojans, and rogue Internet content. Until  fairly recently, experts worried mostly about computer viruses that  spread only through executable files, not data files, and certainly not  through email exchange. The Melissa virus and the Love Bug proved  the experts wrong, attacking Windows computers when recipients did  nothing more than open an email. Today, writing programs is easier than  ever, and so is writing malicious code.  The idea that someone could write malicious code and spread it to 60  million computers in a matter of hours is no longer a fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there &lt;i&gt;are &lt;/i&gt;effective ways to thwart Windows  malicious code attacks, and author Roger Grimes maps them out in
&lt;i&gt;Malicious Mobile Code: Virus Protection for Windows.&lt;/i&gt; His opening  chapter on the history of malicious code and the multi-million dollar  anti-virus industry sets the stage for a comprehensive rundown on  today's viruses and the nuts and bolts of protecting a system from them.  He ranges through the best ways to configure Windows for maximum  protection, what a DOS virus can and can't do, what today's biggest  threats are, and other important and frequently surprising information.  For example, how many people know that joining a chat discussion can  turn one's entire computer system into an open book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Malicious Mobile Code&lt;/i&gt; delivers the strategies, tips, and tricks  to secure a system against attack. It covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The current state of the malicious code writing and cracker community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How malicious code works, what types there are, and what it can and cannot do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Common anti-virus defenses, including anti-virus software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How malicious code affects the various Windows operating systems,  and how to recognize, remove, and prevent it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Macro viruses affecting MS Word, MS Excel, and VBScript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Java applets and ActiveX controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Enterprise-wide malicious code protection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Hoaxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The future of malicious mobile code and how to combat  such code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, when it comes to protecting both home computers and company  networks against malicious code, the stakes are higher than ever.
&lt;i&gt;Malicious Mobile Code&lt;/i&gt; is the essential guide for securing a system from catastrophic loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;"Malicious mobile code" is a new term to describe all sorts of destructive programs: viruses, worms, trojans, and rogue Internet content. Malicious mobile code is more prevalent today than ever before, and both home users and system administrators need to be on the alert to protect their network or company against attacks. &lt;i&gt;Malicious Mobile Code&lt;/i&gt; reveals what such code can and can't do and how to recognize, remove, and prevent it. Readers learn effective strategies, tips, and tricks for securing any system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Programming the Perl DBI</title>
    <author>Tim Bunce, Alligator Descartes</author>

      <subject>COMPUTERS</subject>
      <subject>General</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest strengths of the Perl programming  language is its ability to manipulate large amounts of data.  Database programming is therefore a natural fit for Perl, not only for  business applications but also for CGI-based web and intranet applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary interface for database programming in Perl is DBI.  DBI is a database-independent package that provides a  consistent set of routines regardless of what database product you  use--Oracle, Sybase, Ingres, Informix, you name it. The design of  DBI is to separate the actual database drivers (DBDs) from the  programmer's API, so any DBI program can work with any database,  or even with multiple databases by different vendors simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Programming the Perl DBI&lt;/i&gt; is coauthored by Alligator Descartes, one  of the most active members of the DBI community, and by Tim Bunce,  the inventor of DBI. For the uninitiated, the book explains the  architecture of DBI and shows you how to write DBI-based programs.  For the experienced DBI dabbler, this book reveals DBI's nuances and  the peculiarities of each individual DBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book includes:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;An introduction to DBI and its design
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How to construct queries and bind parameters
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Working with database, driver, and statement handles
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Debugging techniques
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Coverage of each existing DBD
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;A complete reference to DBI
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the definitive book for database programming in Perl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Outlook 2000 in a Nutshell</title>
    <author>Tom Syroid, Bo Leuf</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With most of the books currently on the market for Outlook 2000 falling into the instant-learn, limited-scope "Dummies" category, the  need for an up-to-date and comprehensive reference book such as &lt;i&gt;Outlook 2000 in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is high.  This book is for typical Nutshell readers:  sophisticated computer users who need a comprehensive,  functional reference to the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlook is much more than just an email client. It  is a powerful and versatile program that includes contact, calendar, notes, task, and journal tools all tightly  integrated to give users quick access to vital information  and fast, easy ways to share that information. You  can arrange virtual conferences with NetMeeting, send  Office documents through Outlook Mail, and save  calendars as web pages and publish them to the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Outlook 2000 in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is organized intuitively,  beginning with a program overview examining Outlook's interface and structure along with setup and installation issues. The chapter on program insights delves deeper into the program, looking at data structures, forms, and categories. The second part of the book drills down into Outlook's  individual components and their associated commands,  and the last section covers some sophisticated connectivity  and collaboration issues as well as file management and  encryption. There are also some special sections devoted to working with VBA, using Outlook as an Exchange client, and exploring how Outlook works with Palm devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Program data structures, forms, and views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adaptive menus and toolbars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outlook's component interaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connectivity and collaboration tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importing and exporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with VBA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outlook as an Exchange client&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors worked extensively with Microsoft engineers on the alpha/beta releases of Outlook 98, and bring to the book a wealth  of knowledge and experience. They  have provided a comprehensive task index, designed to speed up the process of locating important  information as well as tips and tricks about the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Outlook 2000 in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is a must-read for any user who wants to get as much out of this software as possible without wasting time weeding through hundreds of  pages of useless information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Outlook 2000 in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; fills the need for an up-to-date and comprehensive reference book for sophisticated users who want to get all they can out of this powerful and versatile program.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domino is one of the most effective platforms for developing and deploying e-business applications, allowing new communities of developers to enjoy its collaborative capabilities. With over 55 million seats worldwide, Domino already provided a strong foundation for messaging and web applications, and the release of R5 builds on that to make Domino easier  to use than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Lotus Domino R5 has been expanded to interact with most browsers and other non-Notes clients, so developers can choose their favorite language to design web applications. With R5, administrators can centrally modify client configurations instead of hopping from one terminal to the next throughout the company. The new Domino interface allows administrators to visually monitor the health and status of the Domino servers in a network from a single screen. All this capability implies complexity, and it's easy to forget which menu to go to. Here's where &lt;i&gt;Lotus Domino Administration in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; can help. It's a quick reference that will come in handy again and again for finding solutions to administrative problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book covers:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Domino architecture and key concepts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R5 administration tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domino directory and console commands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database properties and Access Control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring Domino Enterprise Connection Services (DECS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supporting the Notes client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Domino for IIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the task is messaging servers, modifying administration tasks to a simpler and more efficient level, or ensuring the security and flexibility of a web application server, &lt;i&gt;Lotus Domino Administration in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the reference developers need to make the most of this reliable and scalable integrated server platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The release of R5 has made Domino easier for its 55 million users than ever before. For example, it's now possible to centrally modify client configurations or visually monitor the health and status of the network's Domino servers from a single screen. &lt;i&gt;Lotus Domino Administration in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the quick reference for getting the most out of this reliable and scalable integrated server platform.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Writing Word Macros</title>
    <author>Steven Roman, PhD</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Microsoft Word users and VBA programmers don't realize  the extensive opportunities that exist when Word's Object Model  is accessed using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), which  replaced WordBasic in conjunction with the release of Word 97.   By creating what is commonly called a "Word Macro" you can automate  many features available in Word. &lt;i&gt;Writing Word Macros&lt;/i&gt; (previously titled &lt;i&gt;Learning Word Programming&lt;/i&gt; is the  introduction to Word VBA that allows you to do these things and  more, including:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create custom pop-up menus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatically create tables from lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Append one document to the end (or beginning) of another&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a toggle switch to change a document from draft to  final copy by adding or removing a watermark in the header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate reports using data from other applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
Not intended to be an encyclopedia of Word programming, &lt;i&gt;Writing  Word Macros&lt;/i&gt; provides Word users, as well as programmers who are not familiar with the Word object model with a solid introduction to writing VBA macros and programs. In particular, the book focuses on:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Visual Basic Editor and the Word VBA programming environment.  Word features a complete and very powerful integrated development  environment for writing, running, testing, and debugging VBA macros.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The VBA programming language (which is the same programming language used by Microsoft Excel, Access, and PowerPoint, as well as the  retail editions of Visual Basic).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Word object model. Word exposes nearly all of its functionality through its object model, which allows Word to be controlled programmatically using VBA. While the Word object model, with almost  200 objects, is the largest among the Office applications, readers  need be familiar with only a handful of objects. &lt;i&gt;Writing Word  Macros&lt;/i&gt; focuses on these essential objects, but includes a  discussion of a great many more objects as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;i&gt;Writing Word Macros&lt;/i&gt; is written in a terse, no-nonsense manner  that is characteristic of Steven Roman's straightforward, practical  approach. Instead of a slow-paced tutorial with a lot of hand-holding,  Roman offers the essential information about Word VBA that you must  master to program effectively. This tutorial is reinforced by interesting and useful examples that solve practical programming problems, like  generating tables of a particular format, managing shortcut keys,  creating fax cover sheets, and reformatting documents.
&lt;i&gt;Writing Word Macros &lt;/i&gt; is the book you need to dive into the  basics of Word VBA programming, enabling you to increase your power  and productivity when using Microsoft Word.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;This no-nonsense book delves into VBA programming and tells how you can use VBA to automate all the tedious, repetitive jobs you never thought you could do in Microsoft Word. It takes the reader step-by-step through writing VBA macros and programs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) technology is becoming a standard feature of computer systems that support mission-critical services like file sharing, mail exchange, or Web servers. RAID offers two benefits to these essential systems: improved I/O performance and fail-safe data storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although bandwidth problems on networks are well documented, the internal data transfer bottleneck that exists at the hardware level in each system can also leave you with perplexing performance issues. RAID is a cost-effective and easy-to-manage way to alleviate this bandwidth problem by distributing the I/O load seamlessly across multiple disks and controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAID also provides uninterrupted data access through disk mirroring and parity algorithms. That means systems can remain online even during a disk or controller failure. RAID is scalable, making it robust enough for large, high-traffic sites and small, critical systems. By using RAID, system administrators can combine single disks into terabytes worth of data storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Managing RAID on Linux&lt;/i&gt; covers everything system administrators need to know to put together a system that can support RAID.  You will learn about the different types of RAID, along with associated technologies and issues, and how to choose the best RAID system for your needs. With a step-by-step, hands-on approach, the author guides you through the installation of either Linux software RAID or a hardware RAID card. The book shows how to build an array and optionally install a high-performance file system. Contents include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;An introduction to RAID and Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning and architecture of your RAID system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a software RAID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software RAID tools and references&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a hardware RAID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance and tuning of your RAID system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
RAID has become the low-cost solution of choice to deal with the ever-increasing demand for data storage space.  Written for system administrators, power users, tech managers, and anyone who wants to learn about RAID technology, &lt;i&gt;Managing RAID on Linux&lt;/i&gt; sidesteps the often-confusing vendor-specific approach you'll find elsewhere to give you the straight story on RAID. Even non-Linux users will find this book full of valuable material.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Developing ASP Components</title>
    <author>Shelley Powers</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology has become wildly popular with web developers. However, the techniques for developing custom ASP components, not to mention the inevitable snags and pitfalls, are not well documented. What's more, the successful ASP component developer must be a jack-of-all-trades, with some knowledge of COM and COM+, threading models, and the ASP object model, as well as a mastery of one or more language tools and development environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where &lt;i&gt;Developing ASP Components,&lt;/i&gt; 2nd Edition, comes in. Its first section explores the topics everyone needs to know to develop effective ASP components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Configuring the ASP development environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ASP components and the Component Object Model (COM).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ASP components and threading models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ASP components and Component Services, which provide a variety of services to ASP components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The objects, properties, methods, and events available in the ASP object model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASP components are language independent, and developers increasingly tend to use more than a single language tool. Thus the remainder of the book focuses on ASP component development using one of two major development tools--Microsoft Visual Basic and Microsoft Visual C++ (with the ActiveX Template Library)--along with a number of other languages, such as Perl and Delphi. Each section focuses on the issues that concern the ASP component developer using that particular development environment. These issues include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Accessing ASP's intrinsic objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Accessing data using ADO.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Creating n-tier web applications with VB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Handling persistence using MFC along with Visual C++/ATL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's this strong focus on two major development environments,  along with a thorough grounding in essential ASP topics, that makes
&lt;i&gt;Developing ASP Components&lt;/i&gt;  the definitive resource for the ASP application and component developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) continue to grow in popularity with web developers--especially as web &lt;i&gt;applications&lt;/i&gt; replace web &lt;i&gt;pages.&lt;/i&gt; However, the techniques and pitfalls of developing ASP components are not well-documented. The second edition of &lt;i&gt;Developing ASP Components&lt;/i&gt; has the information and real-world examples you need to create custom ASP components.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>MCSD in a Nutshell</title>
    <author>James Foxall MCSD</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since their introduction, the MCSD certification exams have been enthusiastically received by VB programmers who consider certification very important to their professional credibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers tend to be specialists--they tend to do the same  kind of programming over and over. The MCSD exam is targeted at technical generalists--developers familiar with a broad array of Microsoft technologies and development approaches  that are incorporated into Visual Basic. With its comprehensive overview of core technology areas, &lt;i&gt;MCSD in  a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the perfect study guide and resource to help developers master technologies that are less familiar to them. In fact, its thorough review of Visual  Basic-related development technologies also makes this an excellent tutorial for experienced VB programmers who wish to get up to  speed on speed on some technology with which they work  infrequently, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most certification books are really tutorials in disguise.  In contrast, this book focuses on the advanced  topics about which developers are actually tested on the exam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understanding COM&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating ActiveX Code Components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating ActiveX Controls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating and Using ActiveX Documents&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating Internet-Aware Applications&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Testing and Debugging&lt;/li&gt;            &lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Integrating Help with an Application&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimizing an Application&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Package and Deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporating Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, most certification books appear to assume that the reader has no prior experience with VB programming. In contrast, this book assumes an intermediate to advanced programmer who is concerned with learning more about each of the core technologies that are covered by the exam. And unlike some certification books,
&lt;i&gt;MCSD in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is written by an author who has successfully  passed the certification exams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Oracle Net8 Configuration and Troubleshooting</title>
    <author>Hugo Toledo, Jonathan Gennick</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net8 is the fundamental Oracle technology that allows Oracle  services and clients to communicate with each other over a network.  Net8 is most often used to connect client software to Oracle database  servers. It may also be used to connect database servers to one  another, allowing communication between distributed databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This practical guide provides the information that readers, especially  database administrators, need to know in order to install configure,  tune, and troubleshoot Net8. It discusses how Oracle's network  architecture, products, and name resolution methods work, and it  provides the details of client and server configuration using a variety  of Oracle protocols and networking products, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;The Oracle Internet Directory (OID), Oracle's implementation of the standard Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This directory can be used to maintain a central repository of net service names that can be referenced by all clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Oracle Names, a networking component used mainly in earlier  versions of Oracle, that allows net service names to be defined centrally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Multi-Threaded Server (MTS), an environment in which the client connections share access to a pool of shared server processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Oracle Connection Manager, a Net8 component that acts much like a router and provides protocol conversion, connection concentration, and access control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book also describes the utilities Oracle provides to help manage  a Net8 environment; these include the Listener Control Utility  (lsnrctl), the Oracle Names Control Utility (namesctl), the Oracle  Connection Manager Control Utility (cmctl), tnsping, and Net8 Assistant.  In addition, it provides a variety of networking troubleshooting techniques and  commonly encountered Net8 configuration problems, and provides  complete syntax for all networking files and commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Describes everything DBAs need to know to install configure, tune, and troubleshoot Net8, Oracle's networking technology. It covers the Oracle Internet Directory (OID), Oracle Names; the Multi-Threaded Server (MTS); and the Oracle Connection Manager, as well as the Oracle networking utilities (lsnctl, namesctl, cmctl, tnsping, Net8 Assistant, Net8 Easy Config, and Net8 Configuration Assistant). In addition, it provides networking troubleshooting techniques, commonly encountered Net8 configuration problems, and complete syntax for all networking files and commands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <author>Ales Spetic, Jonathan Gennick</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unique cookbook contains a wealth of solutions to problems that SQL programmers face all the time.  The recipes inside range from how to perform simple tasks, like importing external data, to ways of handling issues that are more complicated, like set algebra.  Authors Ales Spetic and Jonathan Gennick, two authorities with extensive database and SQL programming experience, include a discussion with each recipe to explain the logic and concepts underlying the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SQL (Structured Query Language) is the closest thing to a standard query language that currently exists, and Transact-SQL -- a full-featured programming language that dramatically extends the power of SQL -- is the procedural language of choice for both Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase SQL Server systems. The &lt;i&gt;Transact-SQL Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is designed so you can use the recipes directly, as a source of ideas, or as a way to learn a little more about SQL and what you can do with it.  Topics covered include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Audit logging.  In addition to recipes for implementing an audit log, this chapter also includes recipes for: improving performance where large log tables are involved; supporting multiple-languages; and simulating server push.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Hierarchies.  Recipes show you how to manipulate hierarchical data using Transact-SQL.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Importing data.  This chapter introduces concepts like normalization and recipes useful for working with imported data tables.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Sets.  Recipes demonstrate different operations, such as how to find common elements, summarize the data in a set, and find the element in a set that represents an extreme.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Statistics.  This chapter?s recipes show you how to effectively use SQL for common statistical operations from means and standard deviations to weighted moving averages.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Temporal data.  Recipes demonstrate how to construct queries against time-based data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p/&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Data Structures.  This chapter shows how to manipulate data structures like stacks, queues, matrices, and arrays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an abundance of recipes to help you get your job done more efficiently, the &lt;i&gt;Transact-SQL Cookbook&lt;/i&gt; is sure to become an essential part of your library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Windows NT and Windows 2000 systems have emerged as  viable platforms for Internet servers. More and more organizations are  now entrusting the full spectrum of business activities--including  e-commerce--to Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the typical Windows NT/2000 installation makes a Windows server an easy target for attacks, and configuring Windows for secure Internet use is a complex task. &lt;i&gt;Securing Windows NT/2000 Servers for the Internet&lt;/i&gt; suggests a two-part strategy to accomplish the task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Hardening" any Windows server that could potentially be exposed to  attacks from the Internet, so the exposed system (known as a "bastion  host") is as secure as it can be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing extra security protection for exposed systems by  installing an additional network (known as a "perimeter network") that  separates the Internet from an organization's internal networks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Securing Windows NT/2000 Servers for the Internet&lt;/i&gt; is a concise  guide that pares down installation and configuration instructions into a  series of checklists aimed at Windows administrators. Topics include:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction--Windows NT/2000 security threats, architecture of the  Windows NT/2000 operating system and typical perimeter networks.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to build a Windows NT bastion host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring Windows and network services, encrypting the password  database, editing the registry, setting system policy characteristics,  performing TCP/IP configuration, configuring administrative tools, and  setting necessary permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differences between Windows NT and Windows 2000 security including  IPSec (IP Security Protocol) configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure remote administration--SSH, OpenSSH, TCP Wrappers, the  Virtual Network Console, and the new Windows 2000 Terminal Services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows NT/2000 backup, recovery, auditing, and monitoring--event  logs, the audit policy, time synchronization with NTP (Network Time  Protocol), remote logging, integrity checking, and intrusion detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Administrators who carefully follow the detailed instructions provided  in this book will dramatically increase the security of their Windows  NT/2000 Internet servers.&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>DHCP for Windows 2000</title>
    <author>Neall Alcott</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is an open standard Internet  protocol used to allocate and manage IP addresses dynamically. Before DHCP  came along, administrators had to manually configure each host on a network  with an IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. Maintaining the changes  and the associated logs took a tremendous amount of time and was prone to  error. DHCP uses a client/server model in which the system updates and  maintains the network information dynamically. Windows 2000 provides enhanced  DHCP client-server support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;DHCP for Windows 2000 &lt;/i&gt; is custom-designed for system administrators  who are responsible for configuring and maintaining networks with Windows  2000 servers. It explains the DHCP protocol and how to install and manage  DHCP on both servers and clients--including client platforms other than Windows 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers get detailed and explicit instructions for using Windows 2000 DHCP  to manage their network IP configurations much more efficiently and effectively.They get background information for using DHCP in general, plus complete  information about the Windows 2000 use of DHCP. For those interested in  what's on the horizon, the author steps up to the plate with an analysis of  the future direction of DHCP and Windows support for IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>COM+ Programming with Visual Basic</title>
    <author>Jose Mojica</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of a book like &lt;i&gt;COM+ Programming with Visual Basic&lt;/i&gt; lies in the fact that the Visual Basic programming environment is designed to hide as many low-level system details as possible. While this approach can speed development time by letting you  focus on the task at hand, it actually hinders the process when it obscures details you need to understand or control. Such is often the case for programmers who are developing components that take advantage of COM+ services. &lt;i&gt;COM+ Programming with Visual Basic&lt;/i&gt; takes aim squarely at the information needs of these developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, despite the marketing hype about COM+ as the new and improved version of COM, classic COM is very much the foundation on which COM+ is built: COM+ components are a particular kind of COM component. Visual Basic hides almost all COM implementation details; yet it is precisely in the area of COM+ programming that these hidden details are most important. Therefore, we've devoted significant content to exploring COM internals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Interface-based programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How COM interfaces work internally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How COM components are activated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How versioning COM components works in Visual Basic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second section focuses on incorporating individual COM+ services, like transaction support, security, and asynchronous operations, into applications. The author concludes by discussing what you need to learn to transition to Microsoft's coming .NET framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what lies ahead for .NET, many distributed systems are  being built today with COM+. &lt;i&gt;COM+ Programming with Visual Basic&lt;/i&gt; focuses on topics relevant to distributed applications that are here to stay:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How to use interfaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Passing objects by reference or by value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;What it means to have multithreaded applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How declarative programming works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How to program within a distributed transaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;How to add role-based security to applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's simply no other documentation available for much of what's in
&lt;i&gt;COM+ Programming with Visual Basic.&lt;/i&gt; It's destined to be the resource behind the most robust, efficient, high-performance COM+ applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;COM+ Programming with Visual Basic&lt;/i&gt; draws from the author's wide experience as a COM+ developer and instructor. The first part shows you how to create robust, efficient, high-performance COM+ applications. The second focuses on incorporating individual COM+ services, like transaction support, security, and asynchronous operations, into applications. Not for beginners, this book reveals how COM+ &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; works, as well as how to make COM+ components work with the upcoming Microsoft .NET architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;AppleScript in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is the first complete reference to  AppleScript, the popular programming language that gives both power  users and sophisticated enterprise customers the important ability to  automate repetitive tasks and customize applications. As the Macintosh  continues to expand and solidify its base in the multimedia and  publishing industries, AppleScript is the tool of choice on this  platform for creating sophisticated time- and money-saving workflow  applications (applets). These applets automate the processing and  management of digital video, imaging, print, and web-based material.  AppleScript is also gaining a foothold in scientific programming, as  technical organizations adopt G4 CPU-based systems for advanced  computing and scientific analysis. Finally, "power users" and script  novices will find that AppleScript is a great everyday Mac programming  tool, similar to Perl on Windows NT or Unix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this well-organized and concise reference, AppleScript programmers  will find: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detailed coverage of AppleScript Version 1.4 and beyond on Mac OS 9  and Mac OS X.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete descriptions of AppleScript language features, such as data  types, flow-control statements, functions, object-oriented features  (script objects and libraries), and other syntactical elements.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descriptions and hundreds of code samples on programming the various  "scriptable" system components, such as the Finder, File Sharing, File  Exchange, Network scripting, Web scripting, Apple System Profiler, the  ColorSync program, and the numerous powerful language extensions called  "osax" or scripting additions.

Most other AppleScript books are hopelessly out of date. &lt;i&gt;AppleScript  in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; covers the latest updates and improvements with  practical, easy to understand tips, including:
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using AppleScript as a tool for distributed computing, an exciting  development that Apple Computer calls "program linking over IP."  Programmers can now do distributed computing with Macs over TCP/IP  networks, including controlling remote applications with AppleScript and  calling AppleScript methods on code libraries that are located on other  machines.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the Sherlock find application to automate web and network  searching.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insights on scripting new Apple technologies such as Apple Data  Detectors, Folder Actions, Keychain Access, and Apple Verifier.

&lt;i&gt;AppleScript in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; is a high-end handbook at a low-end  price--an essential desktop reference that puts the full power of this  user-friendly programming language into every AppleScript user's hands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>ASP in a Nutshell</title>
    <author>Keyton Weissinger</author>
    <subjects/>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ASP in a Nutshell&lt;/i&gt; provides the high-quality  reference documentation that web application developers really need to create effective Active Server Pages. It focuses on how features are  used in a real application and highlights little-known or  undocumented features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book also includes an overview of the interaction  between the latest release of Internet Information Server  (version 5) and ASP 3.0, with an introduction to the IIS  object model and the objects it comprises. The examples  shown in this section and throughout the book are illustrated  in VBScript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main components of this book are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Active Server Pages Introduction. Brief overview of the ASP application paradigm with examples in VBScript. Also included is an introduction to Microsoft's Internet Information Server  5.0, the IIS object model, and the objects that it comprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Object Reference. Each object is discussed in the  following manner: descriptions, properties, collections,  methods, events, accessory files/required DLLs, and remarks,  including real-world uses, tips and tricks, and author's  experience (where applicable). The objects--Application,  Response, Request, Server, Session, ObjectContext, and ASPError, as well as ASP Directives, Global.ASA, and Server-Side  Includes--all follow this paradigm.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Component Reference. This section follows the same paradigm found in Object Reference. The discussion covers all of the additional components included with IIS, such as ActiveX Data  Objects, the Ad Rotator, the Browser capabilities component,  the File System Object, and more.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Appendixes. Gives examples in one or two objects and  components using Perl, REXX, and Python in ASP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other books in the "In a Nutshell"  series this book offers the facts, including critical  background information, in a no-nonsense manner that users  will refer to again and again. It is a detailed reference  that enables even experienced web developers to advance  their ASP applications to new levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most capable of all the open source databases,  PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management  system first developed in 1977 by the University of  California at Berkeley. In spite of its long history,  this robust database suffers from a lack of  easy-to-use documentation. &lt;i&gt;Practical PostgreSQL&lt;/i&gt;  fills that void with a fast-paced guide to installation,  configuration, and usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive new volume shows you how to compile PostgreSQL from source,  create a database, and configure PostgreSQL to accept client-server  connections. It also covers the many advanced features, such as  transactions, versioning, replication, and referential integrity  that enable developers and DBAs to use PostgreSQL for serious business  applications. The thorough introduction to PostgreSQL's PL/pgSQL  programming language explains how you can use this very useful but  under-documented feature to develop stored procedures and triggers.  The book includes a complete command reference, and database administrators  will appreciate the chapters on user management, database maintenance,  and backup &amp;amp; recovery. With Practical PostgreSQL, you will discover  quickly why this open source database is such a great open source  alternative to proprietary products from Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft.
Also included is a CD-ROM with Command Prompt's PostgreSQL Application
Server, LXP. The CD covers LXP version 0.8.0 and PostgreSQL version 7.1.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Arguably the most capable of all the open source databases, PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system that--until now--lacked comprehensive, easy-to-use documentation. &lt;i&gt;Practical PostgreSQL&lt;/i&gt; is a fast-paced guide that shows you how to get PostgreSQL installed, configured, and running. This comprehensive book delves into the many advanced features of the PostgreSQL Application Server, LXP, including the the use of SQL within PostgreSQL, and covers basic PostgreSQL database administration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 16 million PDAs shipped to date, Palm has  defined the market for handhelds, having dominated this  class of computing devices ever since it began to outpace  competitors six years ago. The company's strength is the  Palm OS, and developers loyal to this powerful and versatile  operating system have created more than 10,000 applications  for it. Devices from Handspring, Sony, Symbol, HandEra,  Kyocera, and Samsung now use Palm OS, and the number of  registered Palm Developers has jumped to 130,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know C or C++, and want to join those who are satisfying  the demand for wireless applications, then &lt;i&gt;Palm OS  Programming: The Developer's Guide&lt;/i&gt;, Second Edition is the  book for you. With expanded coverage of the Palm OS--up to and  including the latest version, 4.0--this new edition shows  intermediate to experienced C programmers how to build a  Palm application from the ground up. There is even useful  information for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything you need to write a Palm OS application is here,  from user interface design, to coding a handheld application,  to writing an associated desktop conduit. All the major  development environments are discussed, including commercial  products such as Metroworks CodeWarrior, Java-based  environments such as Sun KVM and IBM VisualAge Micro  Edition, and the Free Software Foundation's PRC-Tools or GCC.  The focus, however, is C programming with CodeWarrior and  PRC-Tools. New additions to the second edition include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li type="disc"&gt;A tutorial that takes a C programmer  through the installation of necessary tools and the  creation of a small handheld application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;A new chapter on memory, with a comprehensive  discussion of the Memory Manager APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Greatly expanded discussions of forms, forms  objects, and new APIs for the Palm OS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li type="disc"&gt;Updated chapters on conduits that reflect  the newer Conduit Development Kit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best-selling first edition of this book is still considered  the definitive guide for serious Palm programmers; it's used as  the basis of Palm's own developer training materials. Our  expanded second edition promises to set the standard for the  next generation of Palm developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>AppleWorks 6: the Missing Manual</title>

      <subject>COMPUTERS</subject>
      <subject>Utilities</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you prefer a more streamlined alternative to the bloat and complexity of Microsoft "sport-utility" programs, AppleWorks 6 is the stealth office suite. Hugely popular in classrooms, colleges, and small offices, it's got word processing, graphics, database, web design, spreadsheet, and slide-show functions in a single, beautifully integrated application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, AppleWorks arrives in the hands of four million Apple iMac and iBook buyers. There it sits on the hard drive, a masterpiece of smooth integration and clever interface design, accompanied by templates, art libraries, and fonts--and no printed instructions.
&lt;i&gt;AppleWorks 6: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is the book that should have been in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's new.&lt;/b&gt; The authors place special emphasis on easing the transition into the new AppleWorks 6 interface, its Internet hooks, the Starting Points window, and the new Presentation module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Part by part coverage. &lt;/b&gt; The early chapters delve very deeply into the six core AppleWorks modules, including 85 pages on the word processor alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Power tools. &lt;/b&gt; Much of AppleWorks's power comes from its macros, templates, assistants, customizable Button bar, and web-based clip-art libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Document exchange. &lt;/b&gt; AppleWorks 6 can no longer export Word and Excel files. But this book covers exchanging documents with other programs, versions, and platforms--and includes a 25% discount coupon for MacLink Plus, which restores the file-conversion feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Troubleshooting. &lt;/b&gt; Because this book isn't an Apple publication, the authors freely acknowledge the program's  weaknesses--and offer workarounds. Witty and jargon-free, &lt;i&gt;AppleWorks 6:The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; treats AppleWorks as the serious productivity tool it is. With over 250 illustrations, a 2,000-entry index, and a menu-by-menu explanation of every command, &lt;i&gt;AppleWorks 6: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is as smoothly put together as AppleWorks itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

With over 250 illustrations, a 2,000-entry index, and a menu-by-menu explanation of every command, &lt;i&gt;AppleWorks 6: The Missing Manual&lt;/i&gt; is as smoothly put together as AppleWorks itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HyperText Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, is the backbone of the World Wide Web. HTTP is the language that each web  browser (or other web client) uses to communicate with servers  around the world. All web programmers, administrators, and  application developers need to be familiar with HTTP in  order to work effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;HTTP Pocket Reference&lt;/i&gt; not only provides a solid conceptual foundation of HTTP, it also serves as a quick reference to  each of the headers and status codes that comprise an HTTP transaction. The book starts with a tutorial of HTTP, but  then explains the client request and server responses in more detail, and gives a thorough technical explanation of  more advanced features of HTTP (such as persistent connections and caching). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people use the Web every day without knowing anything about HTTP, but for those who need to get "beyond the browser," this book is the place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <title>Building Internet Firewalls</title>

      <subject>General</subject>
    </subjects>
    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the five years since the first edition of this classic book was  published, Internet use has exploded. The commercial world has rushed  headlong into doing business on the Web, often without integrating sound  security technologies and policies into their products and methods. The  security risks--and the need to protect both business and personal  data--have never been greater. We've updated &lt;i&gt;Building Internet  Firewalls&lt;/i&gt; to address these newer risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kinds of security threats does the Internet pose? Some, like  password attacks and the exploiting of known security holes, have been  around since the early days of networking. And others, like the  distributed denial of service attacks that crippled Yahoo, E-Bay, and  other major e-commerce sites in early 2000, are in current headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firewalls, critical components of today's computer networks,  effectively protect a system from most Internet security threats. They  keep damage on one part of the network--such as eavesdropping, a worm  program, or file damage--from spreading to the rest of the network.  Without firewalls, network security problems can rage out of control,  dragging more and more systems down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the bestselling and highly respected first edition, &lt;i&gt;Building  Internet Firewalls,&lt;/i&gt; 2nd Edition, is a practical and detailed  step-by-step guide to designing and installing firewalls and configuring  Internet services to work with a firewall. Much expanded to include  Linux and Windows coverage, the second edition describes:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Firewall technologies: packet filtering, proxying, network address  translation, virtual private networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architectures such as screening routers, dual-homed hosts, screened  hosts, screened subnets, perimeter networks, internal firewalls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues involved in a variety of new Internet services and protocols  through a firewall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email and News &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web services and scripting languages (e.g., HTTP, Java, JavaScript,  ActiveX, RealAudio, RealVideo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File transfer and sharing services such as NFS, Samba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote access services such as Telnet, the BSD "r" commands, SSH,  BackOrifice 2000 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time conferencing services such as ICQ and talk &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naming and directory services (e.g., DNS, NetBT, the Windows Browser) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authentication and auditing services (e.g., PAM, Kerberos, RADIUS); &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administrative services (e.g., syslog, SNMP, SMS, RIP and other  routing protocols, and ping and other network diagnostics) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intermediary protocols (e.g., RPC, SMB, CORBA, IIOP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database protocols (e.g., ODBC, JDBC, and protocols for Oracle,  Sybase, and Microsoft SQL Server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book's complete list of resources includes the location of many  publicly available firewall construction tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Completely revised and much expanded, the new edition of the highly respected and bestselling &lt;i&gt;Building Internet Firewalls&lt;/i&gt; now covers Unix, Linux, and Windows NT. This practical and detailed guide explains in step-by-step fashion how to design and install firewalls and configure Internet services to work with a firewall. It covers a wide range of services and protocols and offers a complete list of resources, including the location of many publicly available firewalls construction tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Windows 2000 Registry is the repository for all hardware, software, and application configuration settings, and &lt;i&gt;Managing the Windows 2000 Registry&lt;/i&gt; is the system administrator's guide to maintaining, monitoring, and updating the Registry database. The book, which is an update of &lt;i&gt;Managing the Windows NT Registry,&lt;/i&gt; addresses four main areas: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the Registry?  Where does it live on disk?  How do system services access and use it?  What do you do if it's damaged or corrupted?  Every 2000 administrator faces questions like this, often in a  desperate attempt to fix something that's broken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What tools are available?  Detailed descriptions of Regedit, RegEdt32, the System Policy Editor, Group Policy Editor and selected Resource Kit utilities explain how to edit and secure the Registry both on local and on remote computers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I access the Registry from a program?  Regularly monitoring the Registry's contents is one way to preclude unpleasant surprises.  Using examples in C++, Visual Basic, and Perl, &lt;i&gt;Managing the Windows 2000 Registry&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates how to create Registry-aware tools and scripts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's in the Registry?  Not all Registry keys are adequately documented by Microsoft or by the other vendors who store configuration data in the Registry.  &lt;i&gt;Managing the Windows 2000 Registry&lt;/i&gt; offers a guided tour of some of these undocumented keys.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is a "must have" for every 2000 system manager or administrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>

    <abstract>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQL&lt;em&gt;Loader is a ubiquitous tool in the Oracle world. It has been shipped with Oracle since at least Version 6 and continues to be supported and enhanced with each new version of Oracle, including Oracle8 and Oracle8&lt;i&gt;i.&lt;/i&gt; The job of SQL&lt;/em&gt;Loader is to load data from flat files into an Oracle database. It's optimized for loading large volumes of data, and is flexible enough to handle virtually any input format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every Oracle user has to use SQL&lt;em&gt;Loader at one time or another, and DBAs are frequently called upon to load data for the users in their organization. Despite SQL&lt;/em&gt;Loader's wide availability and usage, few DBAs and developers know how to get the most out of  it. &lt;i&gt;Oracle SQL&lt;em&gt;Loader: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt; has everything you need to know to put SQLLoader to its best use: an introduction to SQL&lt;em&gt;Loader, a reference to all of its syntax options, and most importantly, step-by-step instructions for all the SQL&lt;/em&gt;Loader tasks you'd want to perform--and maybe some you didn't realize you COULD perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll learn how to construct the necessary control files and load from different types of files containing different types of data (e.g., fixed-width data, delimited data, and data of various datatypes).  You'll also learn how to validate data, load it selectively, transform it as it is loaded, and recover after failure. This book explains how to optimize SQL&lt;em&gt;Loader performance by adjusting the transaction size and using the new direct path option. It also covers the newest SQL&lt;/em&gt;Loader features--the loading of large object (LOB) columns and the new object types (nested tables, varying arrays, and object tables).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oracle SQL&lt;em&gt;Loader: The Definitive Guide&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;  is an indispensable resource for anyone who is new to SQLLoader; a task-oriented learning tool for those who are already using it; and a quick reference for every user. If you want to take best advantage of an essential Oracle tool, you need this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</abstract>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the wide availability and use of SQL&lt;em&gt;Loader, few Oracle DBAs and developers know how powerful it really is. This book describes all of SQL&lt;/em&gt;Loader's functions, including how to construct the necessary control files, load different types of data, and get the best performance. It covers the newest SQL*Loader features--the loading of large object (LOB) columns and the new object types (nested tables, varying arrays, and object tables).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
